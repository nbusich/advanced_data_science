Abstract

Background: The smoking epidemic in Australia is characterised by historic levels of prolonged smoking, heavy
smoking, very high levels of long-term cessation, and low current smoking prevalence, with 13% of adults reporting
that they smoked daily in 2013. Large-scale quantitative evidence on the relationship of tobacco smoking to
mortality in Australia is not available despite the potential to provide independent international evidence about the
contemporary risks of smoking.
Methods: This is a prospective study of 204,953 individuals aged ≥45 years sampled from the general population
of New South Wales, Australia, who joined the 45 and Up Study from 2006–2009, with linked questionnaire,
hospitalisation, and mortality data to mid-2012 and with no history of cancer (other than melanoma and
non-melanoma skin cancer), heart disease, stroke, or thrombosis. Hazard ratios (described here as relative risks, RRs)
for all-cause mortality among current and past smokers compared to never-smokers were estimated, adjusting for
age, education, income, region of residence, alcohol, and body mass index.

Results: Overall, 5,593 deaths accrued during follow-up (874,120 person-years; mean: 4.26 years); 7.7% of
participants were current smokers and 34.1% past smokers at baseline. Compared to never-smokers, the adjusted
RR (95% CI) of mortality was 2.96 (2.69–3.25) in current smokers and was similar in men (2.82 (2.49–3.19)) and
women (3.08 (2.63–3.60)) and according to birth cohort. Mortality RRs increased with increasing smoking intensity,
with around two- and four-fold increases in mortality in current smokers of ≤14 (mean 10/day) and ≥25
cigarettes/day, respectively, compared to never-smokers. Among past smokers, mortality diminished gradually with
increasing time since cessation and did not differ significantly from never-smokers in those quitting prior to age 45.
Current smokers are estimated to die an average of 10 years earlier than non-smokers.
Conclusions: In Australia, up to two-thirds of deaths in current smokers can be attributed to smoking. Cessation
reduces mortality compared with continuing to smoke, with cessation earlier in life resulting in greater reductions.

Background
The risks of cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory
disease, and a range of other health problems are increased
in tobacco smokers and, as a consequence, smokers are
more likely than non-smokers to die prematurely [1].
Smoking is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality
in virtually every country in the world and is second
only to high blood pressure as a risk factor for global
disease burden [2]. It is arguably the leading readily
preventable factor.

The relative risks of adverse health effects increase
with increasing intensity of smoking, measured by the
amount of tobacco smoked per day, and with increasing
duration of smoking [3]. Smoking cessation imparts sig-
nificant health benefits [3]. The overall effects of smo-
king on mortality in a population relate closely to the
prevalence of current and past smoking and to the dur-
ation and intensity of smoking, among smokers. These
indices relate, in turn, to the factors influencing smoking
behaviour, including the stage of the smoking epidemic
in the population under examination, to the relative
success of tobacco control measures and to cultural and
socioeconomic factors.

Hence, both the relative risks of mortality and the
overall population impacts of smoking are not uniform
across the world and may also vary across time, popula-
tion groups, and birth cohorts within a single location
[3-5]. Large-scale quantitative evidence on the relation-
ship of tobacco smoking to mortality among countries
with a mature smoking epidemic is accruing, but is not
yet available for Australia. In common with many coun-
tries, Australia has relied on the findings from studies
including the British
conducted in the UK and US,
Doctors Study [3] and the American Cancer Society
Cancer Prevention Studies [6], to underpin estimation
of the population impact of smoking [7]. As well as
providing local evidence, large-scale data from Australia
have the potential to contribute to knowledge inter-
nationally by providing additional independent data on
the effects of prolonged, heavy, and widespread smok-
ing. Furthermore, Australia has been among the most
successful nations regarding tobacco control, with most
recent data indicating that 13% of adults in Australia
reported daily smoking in 2013 [8]; data from Australia
are therefore likely to provide insights into the risks of
smoking in settings with high historical prevalence of
smoking and low current prevalence (Figure 1).

This study aims to investigate the relationship of smo-
king to all-cause mortality in Australia, in the 45 and Up
Study cohort. Although cause-specific mortality data have
been used in analyses from other countries, these were
not available for Australia at the time of writing. Partic-
ipants in this population-based cohort study were pre-
dominantly born between 1920 and 1964, and have lived

Australian adults, 1945–2013. Data are from Scollo MM and
Winstanley MH (1945–2010) [9], the Australian Health Survey
(2011–2012) [10], and the National Drug Strategy Household Survey
(2013) [8]. *Prior to 2001, the prevalences indicate those describing
themselves as “current smokers”; from 2001–2010 the prevalences
indicate those smoking daily or at least weekly. In 2011/2012 and
2013, they relate to current smoking, including daily, weekly, or less
than weekly smoking. Data prior to 1980 are considered less reliable
than from subsequent years and are represented with a dotted

through the peak of the smoking epidemic, as well as
through many changes in tobacco policy, legislation, and
health information.

Methods
The Sax Institute’s 45 and Up Study is an Australian co-
hort study of 267,153 men and women aged 45 and over,
randomly sampled from the general population of New
South Wales (NSW), Australia. Individuals joined the
study by completing a postal questionnaire (distributed
from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2008) and giving
informed consent for follow-up through repeated data
collection and linkage of their data to population health

of the 55 diagnostic fields) in the 6 years prior to com-
pleting the baseline 45 and Up Study questionnaire.

Baseline questionnaire data included information on
socio-demographic factors, health behaviours, height
and body weight, medical and surgical history, functional
capacity, and physical activity. The study questionnaire
is available online [12]. To provide data to allow correc-
tion for regression dilution, repeat data on smoking sta-
tus were taken from a resurvey of a sample of 60,404
participants a mean of 3.3 years after recruitment.

Questionnaire data from study participants were linked
probabilistically to data from the NSW Register of Births,
Deaths and Marriages up to 30 June 2012 to provide data
on fact and date of death. This probabilistic matching is
known to be highly accurate (false-positive and false-
negative rates <0.4%) [13]. Death registrations capture all
deaths in NSW. Cause of death information was not avail-
able at the time of analysis. In order to conduct sensitivity
analyses, questionnaire data were also linked probabilistic-
ally to data from the NSW Admitted Patient Data Collec-
tion, which is a complete census of all public and private
hospital admissions in NSW. The linked data that were
used contained details of admissions in participants from
the year 2000 up to the point of recruitment, including
the primary reason for admission using the International
Classification of Diseases 10th revision – Australian Modi-
fication (ICD-10-AM) [14] and up to 54 additional clinical
diagnoses.

Statistical methods
There were 266,777 participants with valid data on age
and date of recruitment. Participants with data linkage
errors (n = 20, 0.01%), age below 45 years at baseline
(n = 3, 0.001%), and missing or invalid data on smoking
status (n = 860, 3%) were excluded. To minimise the
potential impact of changes in smoking behaviour and
higher mortality in those with baseline illness (also
known as reverse causality or the “sick quitter” effect),
participants with a self-reported history of doctor-
diagnosed cancer other than melanoma and/or non-
melanoma skin cancer (n = 30,393, 11%) and those with
a history of cardiovascular disease at baseline, defined as
self-reported doctor-diagnosed heart disease, stroke, or
blood clot on the baseline questionnaire (n = 30,548,
11%) were excluded from this study. It was not possible
individuals with respiratory illness be-
to exclude all
cause this information was not available in an appropri-
ate form from the baseline questionnaire. However,
sensitivity analyses were conducted to investigate the
impact on the main results of additional exclusion of
individuals with a history of admission to hospital with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or other respira-
tory illnesses (defined as an admission to hospital with
ICD-10-AM diagnosis codes J40 to J44 and J47 in any

Smoking status was classified according to the re-
sponses to the following series of items on the baseline
questionnaire: “Have you ever been a regular smoker? If
“Yes”, how old were you when you started smoking
regularly? Are you a smoker now? If not, how old were
you when you stopped smoking regularly? About how
much do you/did you smoke on average each day?”
Never-smokers were participants who answered “No” to
the question, “Have you ever been a regular smoker?”;
current smokers were those who answered “Yes” to this
question and “Yes” to being a smoker now; and past
smokers were those who indicated that they had ever
been a regular smoker but who indicated that they were
not a smoker now. The age at ceasing smoking, among
past smokers, was taken as the age they indicated they
stopped smoking regularly and was categorised as <25,
25–34, 35–44, 45–54, and ≥55 years. Among current
and past smokers, the number of cigarettes smoked per
day was taken from the answer to the question about
how much they smoked on average each day and was
categorised as ≤14, 15–24, and ≥25 cigarettes/day.

Mortality rates since baseline and 95% confidence in-
tervals (CIs) were calculated for participants who report-
ed being current, past, and never-smokers at baseline;
these were indirectly standardised for age to the person-
year distribution of the whole cohort population [15],
and were presented separately for men and women. Haz-
ard ratios (which are equivalent to, and described here
as relative risks [RRs]) for mortality in men and women
were estimated separately for men and women and ac-
cording to birth cohorts with sufficient amounts of data,
using Cox regression modelling, in which the underlying
time variable was age. Estimates are shown initially ac-
counting for age only (automatically adjusted for as the
underlying time variable). Models are then presented
adjusted for additional covariates derived from baseline
questionnaire and participant location data, including
education (<secondary school, secondary school graduation,
trade/apprenticeship/certificate/diploma, university gradu-
ate); annual pre-tax household income (AUD <$20,000,
$20,000–$39,999, $40,000–$69,999, ≥$70,000); region of
residence (major cities, inner regional areas, outer re-
gional/remote areas); alcohol consumption (0, 1–14,
≥15 alcoholic drinks/week), and body mass index (BMI)
(<20, 20–24.99, 25–29.99, ≥30 kg/m2). Missing values
for covariates other than smoking status were included
in the models as separate categories. Hypertension and
dyslipidaemia were considered likely to be part of the
causal pathway between smoking and mortality and
were not adjusted for. Sensitivity analyses were con-
ducted:
i) adjusting additionally for physical activity;
and ii) categorising current smokers as those who

Banks et al. BMC Medicine  (2015) 13:38

reported being current smokers at baseline and past
smokers who had ceased smoking 3 or fewer years prior
to baseline.

Among current and never-smokers at recruitment,
mortality rates and RRs by amount smoked were calcu-
lated according to categories of consumption reported at
recruitment (≤14, 15–24, and ≥25 cigarettes/day). Mor-
tality rates were then plotted against the mean number
of cigarettes within each category reported at the 3-year
resurvey among those who reported being current smokers
at resurvey, as this was considered the best estimate of
long-term mean consumption among all in that category,
before the study started (Additional file 1: Table S1). Rates
in never-smokers were plotted against the “0” on the x-axis.
The RR of dying during the follow-up period was then
in those
quantified among past versus never-smokers,
ceasing smoking at ages <25, 25–34, 35–44, and 45–54
years. Sensitivity analyses were conducted restricting the
data to individuals aged ≥55 years, ensuring that all partic-
ipants had the opportunity to quit at these ages.

The proportionality assumption of the Cox regression
models was verified by plotting the Schoenfeld residuals
against the time variable in each model, with a stratified
form or time-dependent form of the model used where
covariates displayed non-proportionality of hazards. No
violations of the proportionality assumption were detected
for the main exposure. Minor violations were observed in
covariates for certain models and a stratified Cox model
was fitted, as follows: overall analyses of current and past
versus never-smokers – model stratified by education;
analyses relating to birth decade – model stratified by al-
cohol, education, and income; analyses relating to number
of cigarettes smoked per day – model stratified by income;
analyses relating to age at smoking cessation – model
stratified by alcohol and education.

Separately for males and females, absolute mortality
rates for Australian smokers and non-smokers for age
group i (45–54, 55–64, and 65–74 years) were esti-
mated by Mi/(1 + (RR − 1)Pi) for non-smokers and RR
times this for smokers [16] (where Mi and Pi represent
2010/2011 Australian population mortality rates and
smoking prevalence estimated from other sources, re-
spectively [17,18], and RR represents all-cause current
smoker versus never-smoker RRs estimated in the
current study). From these rates, cumulative risks of
death for non-smokers and smokers at age x (55, 65,
or 75 years) from age 45 were estimated by 1− exp

Role of funding sources
The sponsors of this study had no role in study design,

data in the study and had final responsibility for the
decision to submit for publication.

Results
At baseline, 7.7% of the 204,953 study participants re-
ported being current smokers and 34.1% were past
smokers. Of the 84,312 participants with relevant data,
81,179 (96%) smoked only cigarettes, 1,572 (2%) smoked
only pipes/cigars, and 1,561 (2%) reported smoking both.
The prevalence of smoking was similar in men and
women. Compared to never-smokers, current smokers
were, on average, younger, less likely to be urban resi-
dents, of lower income and education level, and less
likely to hold private health insurance; they were more
likely to report consuming ≥15 alcoholic drinks/week
and to have a BMI <20 kg/m2 (Table 1).

The mean age at commencing smoking was similar for
male study participants born in the decades from 1920–
1929 to 1960–1969 (Additional file 2: Table S2). For
women, the average age at commencing smoking de-
creased from 24 years in those born in 1920–1929 to
17 years among those born in 1960–1969, similar to
males born in this decade (Additional file 2: Table S2).
The average duration of smoking in current smokers
was 38.5 years (SD, 9.4 years), with the majority having
smoked for 35 or more years and reporting consuming
15 or more cigarettes per day (Table 2). Because of the
narrow age range of commencing smoking, duration of
smoking among current smokers was strongly corre-
lated with current age (r = 0.8). Data from the 3-year
resurvey indicated consistency of reporting of never-
smoker and ex-smoker status, with little misclassifica-
tion and very few indicating that they had taken up
smoking between surveys (Additional file 1: Table S1).
Among current smokers at baseline who completed
the 3-year resurvey, around one-third indicated that
they were no longer smoking at resurvey, with those
smoking fewer cigarettes per day being more likely to quit
(Additional file 1: Table S1).

Over a mean follow-up time of 4.26 years, 874,120
person-years accrued and 5,593 deaths occurred. The RR
(95% CI) of dying during the follow-up period, adjusting

for age, socioeconomic factors, alcohol intake, and BMI,
was 2.96 (2.69–3.25) in current versus never-smokers
overall, and 2.82 (2.49–3.19) and 3.08 (2.63–3.60) in men
and women, respectively (Figure 2). The adjusted RRs in
past versus never-smokers were 1.43 (1.35–1.52) overall
and 1.34 (1.24–1.45) and 1.54 (1.40–1.70) in men and
women, respectively (Figure 2). Although the absolute
rates of death were higher for men than for women, the
RRs relating to current and past smoking did not differ
substantively between the sexes; nor did they vary materi-
ally according to birth cohort, from 1920–1959 (Figure 2).
The results remained similar following exclusion of indi-
viduals with a history of admission to hospital with a diag-
nosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other
respiratory illness; compared to never-smokers, RRs of
mortality were 2.76 (2.42–3.14) and 2.95 (2.50–3.49) in
male and female current smokers, respectively, with cor-
responding RRs in past smokers of 1.27 (1.17–1.37) and
1.39 (1.25–1.55). RRs did not change materially when fur-
ther adjusted for physical activity and when data among
past smokers were restricted to individuals aged 55 and
over who had the opportunity to cease smoking from age
45–54 (data not shown). Nor did the RRs for mortality in
current and former versus never-smokers change substan-
tially when current smokers were defined as individuals
reporting current smoking at baseline or within 3 years
prior to baseline (for men RR (95% CI) using the new
definitions of current/recent versus never-smokers: 2.65
(2.36–2.96) and former versus never-smokers: 1.34 (1.24–
1.44); the corresponding figures for women were 3.26
(2.84–3.75) and 1.47 (1.33–1.62)).

Among current smokers, the mortality rate during the
follow-up period increased markedly with increasing
number of cigarettes smoked per day, with around a
two-fold increase in mortality in the groups smoking 14
or fewer cigarettes per day (10 cigarettes per day, on
average) and around a four-fold increase in the groups
of current smokers who smoke ≥25 cigarettes per day,
compared to never-smokers (Figure 3 and Additional file 3:
Figure S1). While there was evidence that the increase
in mortality with increasing numbers of cigarettes
smoked was significantly greater for women than for
men (P(interaction) = 0.0002), the confidence intervals were
relatively wide and the absolute mortality rates were con-
siderably higher for men than for women.

The RR of dying during the follow-up period was 1.42
(1.29–1.58) among individuals ceasing smoking at age
45–54, compared to never-smokers (Figure 4); corre-
sponding results were 1.36 (1.20–1.53) among men and
1.52 (1.27–1.82) among women (Additional file 4: Figure
S2). Mortality diminished progressively with increasing
time since cessation of smoking (data not shown) and
did not differ significantly from that in never-smokers in
individuals ceasing use prior to age 45 (Figure 4).

In Australia, male and female smokers were esti-
mated to have the same risks of death 9.6 and 10.1
years earlier than 75-year-old non-smokers, respect-
ively (Figure 5). Starting from age 45, 44.6% of male
smokers in Australia would be estimated to die by age 75,
compared to 18.9% of male non-smokers. Corresponding
figures for females were 33.0% for smokers and 12.2% for
non-smokers.

Discussion
In this large-scale, population-based Australian study,
death rates in current smokers were around three-fold
those of people who had never smoked, in both men
and women. On average, smokers died around 10 years
earlier than non-smokers, over the ages examined. Mor-
tality rates increased substantially with increasing inten-
sity of smoking, with rates approximately doubling in
those smoking around 10 cigarettes per day and four- to
five-fold those of never-smokers in current smokers of
25 or more cigarettes per day. Cessation of smoking
conferred large mortality benefits compared with con-
tinuing to smoke. These findings were adjusted for a range
of potential confounding factors, including socioeconomic
status, alcohol intake, and BMI.

These findings are virtually identical to those on the
contemporary risks of smoking from the UK and US,
where the RR of all-cause mortality in current versus
never-smokers has been consistently reported at 2.8 to
3.0 [3,21-23] and similar to a recent report from Japan
[24]. The finding of similar RRs among smokers across
successive birth cohorts in this study indicates that, in
common with these countries, it is likely that the full
mortality impacts of smoking are being realised among
smokers in Australia. The evolution of increasing smoking-
attributable mortality over time is well documented, with
RRs of all-cause mortality in current versus never-smokers
of around 1.4 to 1.8 in the 1960s to 2.1 to 2.3 in the
1980s [3,6], corresponding to up to around one-third
and one-half of the deaths in smokers being attribut-
able to smoking, respectively. The findings from this
and contemporary estimates from the US and UK indi-
cate that up to two-thirds of deaths in smokers in the
21st century in these settings are likely to have been
caused by smoking [3,6,23]. The progressive increase in
RRs has been attributed to the earlier commencement
of smoking and greater intensity of smoking among
successive birth cohorts, along with reductions in mor-
tality among never-smokers [3,6,23]. In keeping with
this, the smoking-related RRs in countries where wide-
spread heavy and prolonged smoking from an early age
began more recently are somewhat lower than those
observed here [25].

The study provides the first large-scale direct evidence
on the relationship of smoking to mortality in Australia.
The population examined displays quantitatively many
of the characteristics of a mature epidemic of smoking
in the Western context, namely a relatively low preva-
lence of current smoking; similar prevalence of current
smoking in men and women; long durations and stable
intensities of smoking among current smokers; young
and stable age at commencing smoking; a high prevalence
of past smoking; and stable RRs of smoking-related
mortality in successive birth cohorts [26]. Consistent RRs

Categories of smoking intensity (0 (never smokers), ≤14, 15–24, ≥25
cigarettes/day) are based on smoking behaviour reported at
baseline. Rates are plotted against the mean number of cigarettes
within each pre-defined category, based on smoking intensity
reported at the 3-year resurvey among current smokers at resurvey,
to minimise regression dilution bias. Vertical lines represent 95%
confidence intervals; the intervals around the rates for never-smokers
are small and contained within the squares that indicate the rates
[Men 6.8 (6.4–7.2), Women 4.0 (3.8–4.2)].

Figure 5 Estimated cumulative risks of death from age 45 to 75 years in the Australian population in smokers and non-smokers for
males and females.

among successive birth cohorts were observed although
the tar content in cigarettes in Australia has fallen over
the last four decades [9]. The findings also demonstrate
the continuing harms of smoking, despite highly success-
ful tobacco control measures, and the need for continuing
attention and control. The introduction of “plain pack-
aging” for cigarettes in Australia in 2012 is an example of
the continuing efforts required.

This study has the strength of being large and population-
based, with independent and virtually complete data on
the outcome of all-cause mortality. The study ascer-
tained smoking status from questionnaire items that
are based on those used in the Million Women Study,
allowing direct international comparison of results [23].
Repeat data collection on smoking status allowed cor-
rection for regression dilution, such that the findings
relating to smoking intensity are likely to reflect long-
term habits. In keeping with the continuing decline in
smoking prevalence in Australia, the data indicate that
a substantial minority of current smokers at baseline
ceased smoking during the follow-up period. This sug-
gests that the estimated hazard ratios for mortality
among current smokers at baseline are likely to be con-
servative. Although we do not have direct data on use
of smokeless tobacco products among participants, im-
portation and supply of these products has been illegal
in Australia since 1991 and use has been negligible since
then [27].

The study provides evidence on the effects of heavy
and prolonged smoking in a setting where the preva-
lence of smoking is now low. Around 12% of individuals
aged 45 and over in NSW were estimated to be current
smokers at the time when the 45 and Up Study com-
menced [28] and, following exclusions, current smokers
made up around 8% of the cohort. It should be noted
that although the 45 and Up Study is, like the vast ma-
jority of cohort studies, not strictly representative of the
general population, the results presented here are based
on internal comparisons within the cohort and are likely
to be reliable [28]. Moreover, as the British Doctors Study
illustrates, cohort studies do not need to be representative
to produce effect estimates that are generalizable. Follow-
up time was relatively short, which has the advantage of
meaning that smoking status measured at baseline is likely
to broadly represent smoking status during the follow-up
period. NSW is the most populous state in Australia,
comprising around one-third of the total population.
Smoking prevalence and cause-specific death rates for
major causes of death in NSW are similar to those ob-
served nationally [17,18].

To ensure that the study focussed on the likely causal
effect of smoking on mortality, participants who had had
cancer or cardiovascular disease at baseline were exclu-
ded. Although it was not possible to exclude individuals
with chronic respiratory disease, sensitivity analyses in-
dicated that the results did not change materially when

Banks et al. BMC Medicine  (2015) 13:38 

Page 9 of 10

individuals with a previous hospital admission including
a diagnosis of respiratory illness were excluded. Because
of the tendency for smokers, particularly older smokers,
to quit due to ill-health, it was not possible to reliably
estimate the mortality risks in those ceasing smoking at
older ages (i.e., 55 years or older), although they repre-
sented the minority of past smokers. It should be noted
that the findings here are contingent on surviving to age
45; however, few deaths attributable to smoking are likely
to have occurred below this age.

The evidence presented here relates to death from any
cause. Data on cause of death were not available at the
time this study was conducted. International evidence
shows that the vast majority of excess deaths in smokers
are caused by smoking and are due to conditions such
as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and chronic lung dis-
ease. However, it should be borne in mind that a minor-
ity of deaths, such as those related to suicide, may be
increased in smokers but may not be wholly caused by
smoking. Hence, although we are not able to exclude the
relatively small number of deaths that are less likely to
be causally related to smoking, the large majority of the
observed excess mortality in smokers observed here
would have been caused by smoking [3].

Conclusions
The national prevalence of smoking in Australia has
fallen rapidly and is now among the lowest in the world,
with an estimated 13% of adults smoking daily. A num-
ber of countries are moving towards tobacco “eradication”.
These data indicate that, in a low prevalence setting, the
risks of continuing to smoke and the benefits of cessation
remain high.
