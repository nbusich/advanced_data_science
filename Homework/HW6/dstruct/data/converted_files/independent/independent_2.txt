Current Literature

Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes, e-cigs, or electronic nicotine
delivery systems) are battery-operated devices typically
containing glycerol and/or propylene glycol-based solutions with
varying nicotine content, known as e-liquids. Although
e-cigarettes were originally developed as a potentially less
harmful alternative to traditional combustible tobacco cigarette
smokers, several factors have driven their popularity among
smokers and nonsmokers alike, including their sleek product
designs, innumerable appealing ﬂavors, lack of combustible
smoke and odor, and high potential nicotine concentrations.
Furthermore, many advocates have promoted the idea that
e-cigarettes are safe to use, or at least safer than conventional
tobacco, despite limited longitudinal data to support these
claims. Here, we examine what is known about the impacts of
e-cigarette use on traditional cigarette smoking cessation, lung
health, and youth and young adult tobacco product exposure.
Upon review of the currently available literature, the negative
effects of e-cigarette use seem to outweigh any potential beneﬁt,
because the available evidence does not conﬁrm the use of
e-cigarettes as an effective strategy for supporting traditional
combustible tobacco cigarette smoking cessation, particularly
given the emerging adverse effects on lung health and the
potential future public health effects of e-cigarette adoption
among a burgeoning new generation of tobacco product

INTRODUCTION

Electronic cigarettes (also known as e-cigarettes, e-cigs, or
electronic nicotine delivery systems
[ENDS]) are battery-
operated nicotine delivery devices typically ﬁlled with glycerol
and propylene glycol-based solutions with varying nicotine
content, known as e-liquids.1,2 Although e-cigarettes were his-
torically developed to supplant traditional combustible tobacco
use with a less harmful alternative, several factors have driven
e-cigarette popularity, including their many appealing ﬂavors, the
lack of combustible smoke and odor, sleek proﬁles, and high
potential nicotine concentrations. Furthermore, many consumers
and advocates have promoted the idea that e-cigarettes are safe to
use, or at least safer than conventional tobacco. However, limited
longitudinal data exist to support those suppositions, given the
relatively recent emergence of e-cigarettes as a prominent tobacco
product. Here, we examine what is known about the impacts of
e-cigarette use on traditional cigarette smoking cessation, lung
health, and youth and young adult tobacco product exposure.

ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE USE AND SMOKING
CESSATION
Development and current use

The earliest patent for an e-cigarette was granted in August
1965 to Herbert A. Gilbert (US Patent No. 3,200,819),3 who
designed a “smokeless nontobacco cigarette” with multiple ﬂavor
options yet without nicotine, with the intent of replacing the
combustible tobacco cigarette with a safer, less harmful alterna-
tive.4 However,
in focus groups run by tobacco companies,
smokers did not ﬁnd the aerosol produced by Gilbert’s device
appealing,
likely because of the absence of nicotine and the
subsequent inability to activate the dopamine reward system.
The device never made it to market.

In the mid-2000s, the modern e-cigarette was invented and
use skyrocketed in popularity in the United States and Europe,
especially among youths and young adults. Some factors driving
these products include the availability of
the popularity of
thousands of ﬂavors allowing for a personalized product selec-
tion,5,6 minimal regulation by the government resulting in the
perception of their being less harmful than combustible tobacco
products,7,8 and extensive marketing by manufacturers as
smoking cessation aids.9 However, to date, no clear consensus

has emerged regarding the utility of e-cigarettes for smoking
cessation, and e-cigarettes have not been approved by the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation
and Research for this purpose. Although several randomized
controlled trials and observational studies have been conducted
during the past decade to address this speciﬁc question, many
earlier
include control groups, used early-
generation e-cigarette types with poor nicotine delivery, or
were inconclusive owing to the small sample size or challenges in
the study design.

E-cigarettes as smoking cessation aids

Short-term studies (less than 1 year) published to address the
efﬁcacy of e-cigarettes as smoking cessation aids have yielded
dichotomous results.10-13 A 2021 Cochrane analysis evaluated
the effect of e-cigarette consumer product use on smoking
cessation and found that in all adult smokers (odds ratio [OR] ¼
0.947; 95% CI, 0.772-1.1600) and smokers motivated to quit
smoking (OR ¼ 0.851; 95% CI, 0.684-1.057), e-cigarette
consumer product use was not signiﬁcantly associated with a
higher quit rate.14 In contrast, quit rates were higher in cigarette
smokers who used e-cigarettes daily (OR ¼ 1.529; 95% CI,
1.158-2.019) relative to smokers who use e-cigarettes less than
daily (OR ¼ 0.514; 95% CI, 0.402-0.665).11,14 When pre-
scribed as smoking cessation aids and administered free of cost in
randomized control trials, e-cigarettes offer little beneﬁt over
usual care or no treatment.10,12

Furthermore, in the longest observational study performed to
date, Flacco et al11 found no evidence that e-cigarette use
increased smoking cessation rates over a 6-year period (2013-
2019), nor was there evidence of harm reduction in e-cigarette or
dual users (those using both e-cigarettes and combustible ciga-
rettes) compared with cigarette smokers. Abstinence from
combustible tobacco use was assessed with exhaled carbon
monoxide testing in 228 e-cigarette users (all ex-smokers), 469
cigarette smokers, and 215 dual users. Among e-cigarette users,
64.0% remained tobacco abstinent. Tobacco cessation rates were
equivalent in both dual users and tobacco smokers (38.6% vs
33.9%), respectively. The authors found that although the
switch from combustible cigarettes to e-cigarettes supported
abstinence from conventional cigarette use, the continued used
of e-cigarettes in addition to smoking cigarettes did not improve
smoking cessation or reduction.11

E-cigarettes and the harm reduction principle

Harm reduction via e-cigarette use has also been evaluated by
measuring tobacco-speciﬁc toxicants and carcinogens. Like cig-
arettes, aerosols from e-cigarettes have been found to contain
nicotine, nitrosamines, carbonyl compounds, heavy metals, and
particulate matter.12,13,15 Although present in smaller quantities
compared with combustible tobacco products, these chemicals
are well-known for their addictive nature and toxicity.16,17 In the
national cohort Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health
(PATH) study including 3,211 participants consisting of exclu-
sive cigarette smokers
(79.7%), exclusive e-cigarette users
(5.3%), and dual users (15.0%) from waves 1 and 2, ﬁve urinary
biomarkers were
regression
models: (1) nicotine metabolites and minor tobacco alkaloids, (2)
tobacco-speciﬁc nitrosamines,
(3) metals (heavy metals and
speciated arsenic), (4) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and (5)

examined using multivariable

volatile organic compounds. Switching from exclusive cigarette
use to exclusive e-cigarette use (1.2%) resulted in a decreased
urinary toxicant content; however, most participants maintained
exclusive e-cigarette use or became dual users of combustible
cigarettes and e-cigarettes. In these individuals, levels of urinary
toxicants did not decrease.18 Most dual users maintained dual-
use status (37.9%) or transitioned back to exclusive combus-
tible cigarette use (49.1%) 1 year later. The authors concluded
that e-cigarettes tended to be used as supplements to conven-
tional cigarettes, resulting in dual use and reduced efﬁcacy as
smoking cessation aids.

E-cigarettes and nicotine replacement therapy

Treatment with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and
combination therapies for smoking cessation achieves absti-
nence rates of approximately 26% at 6 months and 20% at 1
year.19-21 Compared with traditional NRT, epidemiologic
studies show that e-cigarettes can be more effective than NRT
alone in achieving smoking cessation. Walker and colleagues22
examined the effects of dual NRT using nicotine patches and
nicotine-containing e-cigarettes compared with nicotine patches
alone and nicotine-free e-cigarettes. Unfortunately, a control
cohort using e-cigarettes alone was not included in the study
design. Exhaled carbon monoxide was used to verify continuous
combustible tobacco abstinence at 6 months. Participants in the
nicotine patches and nicotine e-cigarette group had a modestly
higher quit rate (7%) than those in the nicotine patches and
nicotine-free e-cigarette group (4%) (risk difference ¼ 2.99;
95% CI, 0.17-5.81).22 The group treated with nicotine patches
and nicotine
total nicotine
replacement levels compared with the patches-alone group,
which may explain the slightly higher abstinence rate, such that
the role of the speciﬁc nicotine delivery system was not directly
assessed in this study. The quit rate in the nicotine patches-
alone groups was 2% (risk difference ¼ 4.60; 95% CI, 1.11-
8.09), which is extremely low compared with similar NRT
studies. This raises concerns regarding the study design and the
presence of extra-treatment factors that adversely inﬂuenced
NRT.21

received higher

e-cigarettes

The ﬁnding that e-cigarettes are superior to NRT in achieving
smoking cessation was also noted in a 2019 study in which 886
adult smokers were randomly assigned to receive either NRT
(n ¼ 447) or a nicotine-containing e-cigarette starter pack (n ¼
439). In this study, participants also received weekly face-to-face
counseling for 1 year. The primary outcome was sustained
smoking abstinence at 52 weeks. The authors found that 18% of
participants who used e-cigarettes for smoking cessation aids
were no longer smoking conventional
tobacco a year later
compared with 9.9% of participants who used NRT to quit
smoking (relative risk ¼ 1.83; 95% CI, 1.30-2.58; P < .001).23
However, among e-cigarette users, 80% (63/79) were still vaping
a year later (and thus using a tobacco product), compared with
only 9% of participants in the NRT group still using NRT (four
of 44), and 110 participants in the e-cigarette group (25%) had
become dual users.23 Although these ﬁndings

E-cigarettes and addictive potential

The addictive potential of e-cigarettes was evaluated in
another 2019 study using the Fagerstrom test for nicotine
dependence, a 25-item questionnaire modiﬁed to analyze nico-
tine dependence and patterns and attitudes toward using e-cig-
arettes and combustible cigarettes.24 Thirty e-cigarette users, 30
smokers, and 30 dual users were evaluated. Habits and behaviors
associated with using e-cigarettes did not differ signiﬁcantly be-
tween exclusive e-cigarette users and dual users. Surprisingly,
nicotine dependence as measured using the Fagerstrom test for
nicotine dependence was twice as high in e-cigarette users (mean,
3.5) compared with traditional cigarette smokers (mean, 1.6; P <
.001),25 afﬁrming that e-cigarettes can be powerful activators of
nicotine addiction pathways in the brain, and that using these
devices can convey an addictive potential similar to conventional
tobacco products.

Equally disturbing are further data from the PATH cohort
study examining the addictive potential of e-cigarettes in 2,273
adult former tobacco smokers from waves 1 to 4 (2013-2018).
Adult former smokers who reported using e-cigarettes after
wave 1 and who had not used traditional cigarettes during
wave 1 of the PATH trial were found to be at increased risk

ratio ¼ 1.63; 95% CI, 1.04-2.53 in recent former smokers;

smokers).26

traditional

A separate analysis of 26,446 adults completing two waves of
PATH (2013-2014 and 2014-2015) also showed that e-cigarette
use increased rates of new combustible tobacco product use in
adults, compared with adults who had never used e-cigarettes (P
< .001). Adults who had never used e-cigarettes at baseline but
reported ever trying e-cigarettes were four times as likely to have
transitioned to ever smoking combustible cigarettes than never
smokers who had not used e-cigarettes (OR ¼ 4.0; 95% CI, 2.6-
6.1). Adults who used e-cigarettes in the past 30 days were six
times as likely to have transitioned from never to ever combus-
tible cigarette smokers (OR ¼ 6.6; 95% CI, 3.7- 11.8) and eight
times more likely to have become established combustible ciga-
rette smokers (OR ¼ 8.0; 95% CI, 2.8-22.7) than those who
had never used e-cigarettes. These studies emphasize the
importance of discouraging e-cigarette use in former smokers
who had successfully quit smoking, and of advising never-
smokers against initiating use.27

Finally, Beard and colleagues28 examined how far changes in
the prevalence of e-cigarette and licensed NRT use while
smoking were accompanied by changes in cigarette consumption
at the population level in active cigarette smokers. This obser-
vational study performed in England between 2006 and 2016
showed no statistically signiﬁcant associations between changes
in e-cigarette use (b ¼ e0.012; 95% CI, e0.026 to 0.002) or
NRT use (b ¼ 0.015; 95% CI, e0.026 to 0.055) and daily
cigarette consumption.28

Taken together, although some studies have shown that
e-cigarette use may lead to short-term smoking cessation, they
represent an inferior treatment approach relative to well-proven
smoking cessation strategies, and their addictive potential com-
bined with the lack of proven harm reduction supports caution
against their use for smoking cessation.

ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE USE AND LUNG DISEASE
Whereas we have had over 140 years to witness lung diseases
caused by conventional tobacco, we have had less than 20 years to
identify and classify lung diseases associated with e-cigarette use. In
addition, we have only recently begun regularly asking patients
about and documenting e-cigarette use in medical records. As such,
data are limited and often rely on animal studies, case reports,
series, and cohorts describing associated lung effects and symp-
tomatology. Table I lists some of the reported lung health effects of
e-cigarette use in both human and animal studies.

Cytotoxic effects

Whereas e-cigarettes have not been around long enough to
determine whether consistent use leads to common tobacco
producterelated lung diseases
such as emphysema, chronic
bronchitis, interstitial lung diseases, or lung cancer, in vitro and
in vivo studies using animal models have consistently found toxic
and procarcinogenic effects of e-cigarette aerosols. One of the ﬁrst
studies, by Yu et al,29 found that exposure to e-cigarette aerosols led
to DNA strand breaks and cytotoxicity across cell lines. Notably,
this cellular and molecular damage known to drive tumorigenesis
was independent of nicotine. Since that publication in 2016,
several groups have identiﬁed further DNA damaging and DNA-
repair limiting effects of e-cigarettes,30-32 as well as direct cyto-
toxic30,33-36 and carcinogenic31,37 effects of e-cigarettes.

Cellular immunomodulation

Immune cells, which are important pathologically across lung
diseases such as pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, asthma, and

2846

GIOVACCHINI ET AL

J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT
NOVEMBER 2022

cancer, have been found to be phenotypically and functionally
altered and immunomodulated by e-cigarette aerosols and their
components. This is particularly concerning in the setting of
infection, because the diminished ability of host defense cells to
clear pathogens (bacteria, viral, and fungal) predicts that e-ciga-
rette users may have higher rates and higher severity of infectious
diseases. Through murine studies, data in this area have emerged
in both airway and lung parenchymal immune cells,38,39 raising
concern regarding increased susceptibility to pneumonia, as well
as in circulating immune cells and those within distant organs
(heart
and colon), potentially increasing susceptibility to
bacteremia, sepsis, and multiple-organ failure in the setting of an
infectious challenge. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to
ensure these ﬁndings are similarly borne out in human cells with
typical e-cigarette product use.

Accordingly, some of the most common questions during the
COVID-19 epidemic were whether e-cigarette use increased the
risk for being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and whether vaping
increased severity and mortality. Although these questions have
not yet been answered to our satisfaction in human subjects, the
data are most supportive of e-cigarette users having more respi-
ratory symptoms even before viral infections,40-43 with poten-
tially increased symptoms in the setting of COVID-19.44 One
national cross-sectional survey of adolescents and young adults
(aged 13-24 years) performed in May 2020 found that both
e-cigarette users and dual e-cigarette and cigarette users were
more likely to receive a diagnosis of COVID-19 compared with
nonusers, and ever-users of e-cigarettes were ﬁve times more
likely to test positive (OR ¼ 5.05; 95% CI, 1.82-13.96),45
although the authors noted that there were likely both immu-
nologic and social contributors
to positive testing among
e-cigarette-using young adults. There are no convincing data that
e-cigarette use leads to greater disease severity or higher mortality
in COVID-19.46,47 However, murine and in vitro data suggest
that daily e-cigarette use leads to increased angiotensin convert-
ing enzyme-2 expression48-50 and is associated with more severe
acute lung injury in the setting of viral infections, including a
murine coronavirus and inﬂuenza virus.51,52 Thus, the current
conclusion is that e-cigarette use likely leads to altered inﬂam-
matory responses in the lungs, which potentially will inﬂuence
disease severity in some viral lung infections.

Data on immunophenotype changes induced in innate im-
mune cells, both present in the lungs at baseline and recruited
during inﬂammatory and infectious challenges, can be insightful
as to why e-cigarette use may lead to altered inﬂammatory re-
sponses in the lungs. Human alveolar macrophages and murine
bone marrowederived macrophages exposed to e-cigarette
aerosols have decreased phagocytosis and efferocytosis.33,53 Hu-
man macrophages differentiated from the monocytic THP-1 cell
line exposed to multiple common components of e-liquids
(nicotine, propylene glycol, glycerol, and numerous ﬂavorants)
show diminished phagocytosis of bacteria after nicotine or ﬂavor
exposure, and diminished inﬂammatory cytokine secretion after
exposure to any e-liquid component, including ﬂavors.54 Neu-
trophils from the circulation of e-cigarette aerosols as well as
those exposed to e-cigarette aerosol extracts were found to have
altered neutrophil extracellular trap formation and diminished
antimicrobial function.55 Epithelial cells, which themselves have
multiple antimicrobial and inﬂammatory functions, demonstrate
increased permeability and diminished signaling for help after e-
cigarette exposure.56 This combination of
functional and

changes

across macrophages, neutrophils,

and
phenotypic
epithelial cells suggests that e-cigarette use affects the innate
immune system, reducing functional abilities to response to in-
fectious challenges.

Potential for clinical disease development

Murine models are one of our only tools with which to
determine whether e-cigarette use may cause disease over time,
because exposure of mice to e-cigarette aerosols for months is the
equivalent of years to decades in humans.57 Broadly, murine
models have demonstrated that emphysema can occur owing to
e-cigarettes, but it may be a factor of both genetics and expo-
sure,58-60 and that pulmonary ﬁbrosis may be promoted by using
e-cigarettes.60 In addition, multiple groups have shown dimin-
ished host responses to infectious challenges in the setting of
inhalation (bacterial and viral),51,55 and
e-cigarette aerosol
increased pathogen virulence (bacterial and fungal).35,61 One of
the most shocking studies of 2019 was the article by Tang et al,37
which demonstrated an increase in lung adenocarcinoma
tumorigenesis in the setting of a year of daily e-cigarette aerosol
exposure, depending on the presence of nicotine within the
aerosols. Finally, e-cigarette exposure daily for months has been
shown to cause disease beyond the lung, including cardiac, renal,
and hepatic ﬁbrosis, neuroinﬂammation in the central nervous
system, and altered inﬂammatory states
in the heart and
colon.56,62

Although much is still unknown, there are multiple reports
identifying e-cigarette use as the cause of a variety of more acute
and subacute lung diseases, including eosinophilic pneumonia,63
hypersensitivity pneumonitis,64,65 bronchiolitis,66 organizing
pneumonia,67 alveolar hemorrhage,68,69 and acute respiratory
distress syndrome. In many of these cases, patients became
critically ill before clinicians could recognize or identify the
inhalant use as a potential driver. Thus, these few cases that were
identiﬁed as related to e-cigarettes suggest that many more may
be occurring across the world but are not being identiﬁed as
related to vaping.

The e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated
lung injury epidemic

In 2019, a lung disease speciﬁc to vaping of tetrahydrocan-
nabinol (THC) was identiﬁed: e-cigarette or vaping product use-
associated lung injury.70,71 Many of the affected patients were
teenagers or young adults, and some required our highest level of
support, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.65,66,72 Whereas
the e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury
epidemic is a disease of THC vapers (cases have continued to be
identiﬁed into 2022), this epidemic brought to light the dangers
of inhaling chemicals that have never been assessed for potential
pulmonary (and whole-body) toxicity. It took over 60 deaths and
thousands of vapers falling ill before vitamin E acetate was
identiﬁed as the causal agent, which was being added to THC
containing e-liquids by retailers. Of note, vitamin E does not
sound dangerous, and liquid formulations are widely available in
stores and online. Many people ingest it or apply it topically,
because it is generally considered safe for consumer use. Thus, it
came as a surprise to many to ﬁnd that it was highly toxic to lung
cells when inhaled. Because there has been no regulation of what
chemicals can and cannot be added to nicotine or THC e-liq-
uids, it may be only a matter of time until the next lung injury
epidemic owing to vaping devices occurs.

secondhand smoke (SHS) exposures. It is well-documented that
secondhand smoke exposure leads to suppressed lung develop-
ment in children and increased development of obstructive lung
disease, and promotes
in
otherwise nonsmokers. Because e-cigarettes have been touted as
healthier and safer than conventional tobacco, and because of the
less averse smell and look of e-cigarette aerosols compared with
conventional tobacco smoke, many parents who switched to
e-cigarettes began vaping in their homes and cars in the presence
of their children. This has led to high secondhand e-cigarette
aerosol exposures in those who live with e-cigarette users.
However, we now have data demonstrating that lung diseases
and respiratory symptoms are occurring as the result of second-
hand e-cigarette aerosol exposure.73 Galiatsatos et al74 identiﬁed
a case of hypersensitivity pneumonitis resulting from secondhand
e-cigarette aerosol exposure, whereas Alnajem et al73 showed an
increase in wheeze and asthma. Accordingly,
secondhand
e-cigarette exposure may not be as innocuous as previously
considered, and further studies are needed to explore the po-
tential future implications of e-cigarette use on lung health.

ELECTRONIC CIAGARETTE USE AMONG
ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS

The past decade has seen a sharp rise in the use of e-cigarettes
and vaping devices globally among youth and young adults.
E-cigarettes have become ﬁrmly established as the most commonly
used tobacco product among youth in the United States since
2014.75,76 In 2020, nearly one in ﬁve high school students
(19.6%) reported currently using e-cigarettes.75,77 The ongoing
adoption of e-cigarettes among America’s youth has garnered
signiﬁcant recent attention from public health advocates, because
their uptake has dampened efforts to combat tobacco product use
among adolescents. E-cigarette popularity is to blame for the
concerning plateau in the use of tobacco products among high
school students. More than one in four high school students
(26.3%) continue to report current use of tobacco products.75,77

Potential
tobacco product use

for

relative harm reduction in youth

Some authors have proposed that this shift to using e-ciga-
rettes among youths is a positive trend, arguing that this may
represent a relative reduction in harm compared with the sig-
niﬁcant short- and long-term risks of traditional tobacco smok-
ing. For example, in their cross-sectional matched control study,
Shahab et al78 used behavioral controls and propensity score
matching within data between the 2014 and 2017 National
Youth Tobacco Surveys to compare cigarette smoking rates of
adolescents who ﬁrst tried e-cigarettes compared with those who
ﬁrst tried cigarettes or more traditional tobacco products. They
found that compared with adolescents who had tried a traditional
cigarette as their ﬁrst tobacco initiation product, adolescents who
had used an e-cigarette ﬁrst were less likely to be both past
30-day cigarette smokers (OR ¼ 0.15; 95% CI, 0.12-0.18) and
established cigarette smokers (OR ¼ 0.04; 95% CI, 0.03-0.07).
This suggests that youths who try e-cigarettes as their ﬁrst to-
bacco product may be less likely to transition to traditional to-
bacco products in the future relative to those whose ﬁrst tobacco

GIOVACCHINI ET AL

2847

product is conventional tobacco; less than 1% of young e-ciga-
rette users in that study became established traditional cigarette
smokers. Similarly, using data from the ﬁrst three annual waves
of the nationally representative sample of baseline tobacco-naive
youths enrolled in the PATH study, Xu et al79 found that the
risk for past 30-day combustible cigarette use was comparatively
sevenfold lower when youths
started with an e-cigarette
compared with a combustible cigarette. One hypothesis as to
why using e-cigarettes ﬁrst may lead to these youths and young
adults sticking with e-cigarettes alone comes from Jankowski
et al,25 who found that nicotine dependence was two times
greater in young (mean age, 22.4 years) e-cigarette users versus
conventional cigarette smokers (mean age, 3.54 vs 1.64 years; P
< .001). However, unlike in the study by Shahab et al, Xu et al
importantly noted that among tobacco-naive youth in the PATH
study, the initiation of e-cigarette use was associated with greater
risk for subsequent initiation of combustible cigarette smoking
(OR ¼ 3.42; 95% CI, 9.68-68.72) as well as past 30-day
combustible cigarette use (OR ¼ 2.88; 95% CI, 1.22-6.86).
However, this risk was higher when youths started with a
combustible cigarette.79

Transition to traditional cigarette use

Unfortunately, numerous other prospective,

longitudinal
studies have demonstrated the strong association between the
onset of youths’ e-cigarette use and subsequent traditional ciga-
rette smoking.80-84 For example, in their longitudinal survey of
high school students in southern California, Leventhal et al80
found that even when adjusted for various sociodemographic,
environmental, and intrapersonal factors including risk behav-
iors, baseline e-cigarette use was associated with a signiﬁcant
increase in the odds of traditional cigarette smoking in the similar
range of 1.75 to 2.96 (OR), depending on the outcome.
Furthermore, in a meta-analysis of nine US-based studies, Soneji
et al82 reported a concordant pooled OR for subsequent tradi-
tional cigarette smoking of 3.62 (95% CI, 2.42-5.41) for ever
versus never e-cigarette users, after adjusting for known de-
mographic, psychosocial, and behavioral risk factors for tradi-
tional cigarette smoking, with an even higher relative OR of 4.28
(95% CI, 2.52-7.27) among youths who reported e-cigarette use
in the past 30 days.

One recently published study comparatively evaluating data
from the more recent PATH study waves 4 to 4.5 (years 2016-
2018) and 4.5 to 5 (years 2017-2019) shows that whereas this
strong association between ever e-cigarette use and subsequent
transition to combustible cigarette smoking held in waves 1 to 3,
an attenuation of the signiﬁcance of this transition occurs in
waves 4 to 4.5 (adjusted OR [aOR] ¼ 1.40; 95% CI, 0.91-2.14)
and in waves 4.5 to 5 (aOR ¼ 1.35; 95% CI, 0.84-2.16),85
despite the relatively high ongoing use of e-cigarettes as the
current tobacco product of choice among youths in the United
States.77 One theory for this is that newer-generation e-cigarettes
and ENDS for vaping are more efﬁcient at nicotine delivery and
may be supplanting the need for traditional combustible cigarette
use to obtain a greater high once dependence has occurred.86,87
Historically traditional combustible cigarettes have allowed for
the fastest and most efﬁcient delivery of nicotine among the array
of available tobacco products,79,86,88 reinforcing their status as

some of the most addictive products sold on commercial mar-
kets. However, the more recent advent of customizable Pod Mod
devices coupled with innovations in nicotine chemistry allow for
the use of less caustic protonated nicotine formulations derived
from the nicotine salts in loose-leaf tobacco as well as perhaps
even more appealing, completely synthetic nicotine salts. Thus,
newer-generation e-cigarettes and ENDS are now able to deliver
much higher nicotine concentrations than combustible cigarettes
without the traditional acerbic taste and inhalational effects

commonly associated with combustible
These devices have additional appeal among youths because
they often have sleek, easily concealed designs resembling pens or
USB devices or are even made to resemble smartphones, gaming
devices, and popular cartoon characters.86,87,93 Furthermore,
newer-generation salt-based nicotine e-liquids are available in a
host of attractive fruity, minty, and candy-based ﬂavors that hold
appeal for youthful users, which can further mask subjective
caustic initial effects of higher-dose nicotine inhalation,86,87,94
are associated with an increased odds of adolescent vaping
continuation (aOR ¼ 3.76; 95% CI, 1.20-10.31) and a higher
level of nicotine-containing puffs taken on each vaping event
(mean, 3.1 (cid:2) 5.5 vs 1.5 (cid:2) 3.8), compared with the use of
unﬂavored tobacco or menthol ﬂavors among youths who use
e-cigarettes.94 Data from the most recent 2021 NYTS revealed
that among youths currently using e-cigarettes,
the most
commonly used device type was disposables. Both high school
and middle school students reported that their usual brand of
choice was Puff Bar (Puff Bar, Wilmington, DE; 26.1% and
30.3%, respectively),75 a nicotinic saltebased product with ﬂa-
vors such as Guava Ice and Strawberry Banana. In fact, likely
owing to this combination of reduced acridity, potentially higher
nicotine content, and widely available range of ﬂavors, all of the
most recently reported top brands of choice favored among
youths currently using e-cigarettes including Puff Bar, VUSE
(R.J. Reynolds Vapor Company, Winston-Salem, NC), SMOK
(Shenzhen IVPS Technology CO., Shenzhen, China), and
JUUL (Altria Group, Richmond, VA),75 offer nicotine
saltebased products as top-selling products with increasing gains
in sales market share.95

The use of these newer, rapidly absorbed, salt-based nicotine
products and subsequent regular high-level exposure to nicotine
among youths creates additional concern for public health ofﬁ-
cials because it is well-known that the developing adolescent
brain is particularly susceptible to the effects of nicotine, which
has been shown to inﬂuence long-term molecular, biochemical,
and functional changes that increase the risk for future subse-
quent addictive behaviors, risk taking, and substance depen-
dence.89,96,97 Moreover, numerous studies have demonstrated
the association between e-cigarette use among youths and other
risk-taking behaviors including the use of alcohol and progression
inhalational
to
cannabis.89,96-99 Furthermore, youths’ exposure to nicotine via
e-cigarettes is associated with increased risk for mood, attention,
and sleep disorders.86,91,97,100-102 Perhaps most concerningly,
Kim et al101 found that after adjusting for a variety of socio-
economic demographics, risk-taking behaviors, and reported
stress levels, both male and female adolescents who used e-cig-
arettes had signiﬁcantly higher rates of suicidal ideation, suicide
planning, and actual suicide attempts than either traditional
combustible cigarette users or never-smokers. The authors cited

the possible contribution of higher peak level nicotine exposures,
addiction rates, and withdrawal symptoms from the popular
newer-generation nicotinic salt
formulation e-cigarette and
ENDS as a likely contributor to their ﬁndings. Concordantly,
Zhang et al103 found that among youths currently using e-cig-
arettes, 63.9% reported the desire to attempt to quit e-cigarette
use, and that
those reporting current nicotine dependency
symptoms were more concerned about the e-cigarette use and
more likely to have made a past-year attempt to quit (adjusted
prevalence ratio ¼ 1.17; 95% CI, 1.06-1.29). This underscores
the need for a comprehensive approach to tobacco prevention
and control among this new generation of youths for whom
nicotine dependence is developing through even the sole use of e-
cigarettes as the only tobacco product.

to

Taken together, it is unsurprising that the evolving body of
literature on the use of e-cigarettes among youths has caused a
signiﬁcant amount of consternation among those concerned with
the health and well-being of adolescents and young adults. Calls
have arisen for stronger regulatory actions in the e-cigarette and
ENDS device markets.75,77,86,87,104-106 In recent years, these
calls have led to efforts at the federal level by the FDA to limit
the sales of e-cigarettes to America’s youth by increasing the
federal minimum legal
tobacco products
including e-cigarettes from 18 to 21 years across the United
States.104,107 The FDA also put forth a prioritized effort to
regulate ﬂavored, preﬁlled cartridge-based e-cigarettes as of
2020.75,108 Perhaps owing to these efforts, data from the Na-
tional Youth Tobacco Surveys demonstrated that current use of
e-cigarettes declined for the ﬁrst time in recent years between
2019 and 2020 among both high school (27.5% to 19.6%) and
middle school students (10.5% to 4.7%).77

sales age for all

However, loopholes still exist in the ongoing development of
ﬂavored products and persistent pervasive marketing targeted at
underaged e-cigarette users. Approximately 68% of US middle
and high school students reported ongoing exposure to e-ciga-
rette advertisements from both physical retail stores and Internet-
based sources in 2020.109 Furthermore, a recent survey among
youths and young adults in California revealed that despite being
under the legal age of 21 required for vaping device purchases in
that state, most users (59.9%) reported being able to purchase
their own devices both in person at vape shops and from online
retailers.92 Ongoing federal, state, and local efforts to prevent and
reduce youth tobacco product use, including the use of e-ciga-
rettes, will be imperative as the landscape of youth e-cigarette
exposure continues to evolve.

CONCLUSION

Although e-cigarettes are a relatively new addition to the to-
bacco product market, their recent uptake among consumers,
particularly among youths and young adults, warrants signiﬁcant
attention given the potential implications for both individual-
level and population-based health outcomes. Currently,
the
negative effects of e-cigarette use seem to outweigh any potential
beneﬁt, because the available evidence does not conﬁrm the use
of e-cigarettes as an effective strategy for supporting traditional
combustible tobacco cigarette smoking cessation, particularly
owing to the emerging adverse effects on lung health and
