Mortality in relation to smoking: 50 years’ observations on male
British doctors
Richard Doll, Richard Peto, Jillian Boreham, Isabelle Sutherland

Abstract

Objective To compare the hazards of cigarette smoking in men
who formed their habits at different periods, and the extent of
the reduction in risk when cigarette smoking is stopped at
different ages.
Design Prospective study that has continued from 1951 to
2001.
Setting United Kingdom.
Participants 34 439 male British doctors. Information about
their smoking habits was obtained in 1951, and periodically
thereafter; cause specific mortality was monitored for 50 years.
Main outcome measures Overall mortality by smoking habit,
considering separately men born in different periods.
Results The excess mortality associated with smoking chiefly
involved vascular, neoplastic, and respiratory diseases that can
be caused by smoking. Men born in 1900-1930 who smoked
only cigarettes and continued smoking died on average about
10 years younger than lifelong non-smokers. Cessation at age
60, 50, 40, or 30 years gained, respectively, about 3, 6, 9, or 10
years of life expectancy. The excess mortality associated with
cigarette smoking was less for men born in the 19th century
and was greatest for men born in the 1920s. The cigarette
smoker versus non-smoker probabilities of dying in middle age
(35-69) were 42% v 24% (a twofold death rate ratio) for those
born in 1900-1909, but were 43% v 15% (a threefold death rate
ratio) for those born in the 1920s. At older ages, the cigarette
smoker versus non-smoker probabilities of surviving from age
70 to 90 were 10% v 12% at the death rates of the 1950s (that is,
among men born around the 1870s) but were 7% v 33% (again
a threefold death rate ratio) at the death rates of the 1990s (that
is, among men born around the 1910s).
Conclusion A substantial progressive decrease in the mortality
rates among non-smokers over the past half century (due to
prevention and improved treatment of disease) has been wholly
outweighed, among cigarette smokers, by a progressive increase
in the smoker v non-smoker death rate ratio due to earlier and
more intensive use of cigarettes. Among the men born around
1920, prolonged cigarette smoking from early adult life tripled
age specific mortality rates, but cessation at age 50 halved the
hazard, and cessation at age 30 avoided almost all of it.

Introduction

During the 19th century much tobacco was smoked in pipes or
as cigars and little was smoked as cigarettes, but during the first
the 20th century the consumption of
few decades of
manufactured cigarettes increased greatly.1 This led eventually to
a rapid increase in male lung cancer, particularly in the United

Kingdom (where the disease became by the 1940s a major cause
of death). Throughout the first half of the 20th century the haz-
ards of smoking had remained largely unsuspected.1 Around the
middle of the century, however, several case-control studies of
lung cancer were published in Western Europe2–6 and North
America,7–10 leading to the conclusion in 1950 that smoking was
“a cause, and an important cause” of the disease.5

1951 prospective study
This discovery stimulated much further research into the effects
of smoking (not only on lung cancer but also on many other dis-
eases), including a UK prospective study of smoking and death
among British doctors that began in 1951 and has now
continued for 50 years.11–17 The decision that this study would be
conducted among doctors was taken partly because it was
thought that doctors might take the trouble to describe their own
smoking habits accurately, but principally because their
subsequent mortality would be relatively easy to follow, as they
had to keep their names on the medical register if they were to
continue to practise. Moreover, as most doctors would
themselves have access to good medical care, the medical causes
of any deaths among them should be reasonably accurately
certified.

The 1951 study has now continued for much longer than
originally anticipated, as the doctors did indeed prove easy to
follow, and they provided further information about any changes
in their smoking habits along the way (in 1957, 1966, 1971, 1978,
and 1991). A final questionnaire was sent out in 2001.

By 1954 the early findings11 had confirmed prospectively the
excess of lung cancer among smokers that had been seen in the
retrospective studies.2–10 Findings on cause specific mortality in
relation to smoking were published after four periods of follow
up (after four years,12 10 years,13 20 years,14 15 and 40 years17). The
early results from this study,12–14 together with those from several
others
smoking was
associated with mortality from many different diseases. Indeed,
although smoking was a cause of the large majority of all UK
lung cancer deaths, lung cancer accounted for less than half of
the excess mortality among smokers.

that began soon after, showed that

As recently as the 1980s, however, the full eventual effects on
overall mortality of smoking substantial numbers of cigarettes
throughout adult life were still greatly underestimated, as no
population that had done this had yet been followed to the end
of its life span. The present report of the 50 year results chiefly
emphasises the effects on overall mortality (subdivided by period
of birth) of continuing to smoke cigarettes and of ceasing to do
so at various ages.

Long term hazards
With the passage of time and the maturation among UK males
of the smoking epidemic—that is, the arrival of a period in which
even in old age those who still smoked had, in general, been
smoking cigarettes regularly since youth—the 40 year results17
showed that the risks from really persistent cigarette smoking
were much larger than had previously been suspected1 and sug-
gested that about half of all persistent cigarette smokers would
eventually be killed by their habit. The 50 year results consolidate
these findings, following even the participants who were born
after 1900 well into old age.

Britain was the first country in the world to experience a
large increase in male lung cancer from cigarette smoking.18–20
But, even in Britain, those born in the latter part of the 19th cen-
tury had, at a given age, much lower lung cancer rates than the
worst affected generation of men who were born in Britain in the
first few decades of the next century. Hence, after presenting the
findings for mortality during 1951-2001 in the study as a whole,
this report considers separately the findings among those
doctors born in the 19th century (1851-1899) and those born in
the 20th century (1900-1930, considering separately 1900-1909,
1910-19, and 1920-29). Only among those born in the 20th
century—many of whom were young when they started smoking
substantial numbers of cigarettes—can we hope to assess the full
hazards of continuing to smoke cigarettes throughout adult life,
and, correspondingly, the full long term benefits of stopping at
various ages.

Previous reports of this and other studies13 14 17 21 22 have
reviewed the associations of smoking with many specific causes
of death and considered the reasons for them, leading to the
conclusion that in this study the substantial differences between
smokers and non-smokers in overall mortality are due chiefly to
the causal effects of smoking. This report therefore uses only 11
major categories of cause of death, some of which are quite
broad, and several of its main analyses are of all cause mortality.

Methods

Information about smoking habits was obtained in 1951, and
periodically thereafter, from two thirds of all male British
doctors, and their cause specific mortality has been monitored
prospectively
the
information available from state records with data from personal
inquiries.

from 1951 to 2001,

supplementing

Study population
The 1951 questionnaire was sent to all doctors resident in the
United Kingdom whose addresses were known to the BMA. At
that
time no relevant ethics committees existed. Usable
responses were received from two thirds, yielding information on
the smoking habits of 34 439 male doctors (10118, 7477, 9459,
and 7385 respectively born before 1900, in 1900-1909, in 1910-
19, and in 1920-30). Their age specific smoking habits have been
reported previously14; only 17% were lifelong non-smokers.

Efforts have been made to follow until 2001 all those not
known to have died, with the exception of 17 who were struck off
the medical register for unprofessional conduct, 467 who
requested (mostly in the fifth decade of the study) no further
questionnaires, and 2459 who were known to be alive but living
abroad on 1 November 1971, when we withdrew them. Among
the remaining 31 496 the follow up of mortality is, irrespective of
any other migration, 99.2% complete (with only 248 untraced
(usually since the 1970s)); 5902 are known to have been alive on
1 November 2001 and 25 346 are known to have died before
then. Those withdrawn before the end of the study or untraced

are included in the analyses of mortality until the time of
withdrawal, or until contact was last made.

Questionnaires
The original questionnaire in 1951 asked only a few questions
about the individual’s current smoking habits or, for ex-smokers,
about the types and amounts of tobacco last smoked. These were
elaborated in further questionnaires in 1957, 1966, 1971, 1978,
and 1991, to which the response rates (after reminders) varied
between 98% initially and 94% finally. Accounts of the questions
asked have been reported previously,11–17 as have the trends in
cigarette consumption.14 Only the 1978 questionnaire,16 which
was
limited to those born in the 20th century, sought
information about a wide range of characteristics (height, weight,
blood pressure, alcohol, etc, including medical history) and asked
those who had stopped smoking whether they had done so
because they had already developed some serious respiratory or
vascular disease. The 2001 questionnaire sought only to check
that we had identified correctly the individuals we believed we
had traced.

To help assess the effects of persistent cigarette smoking,
those categorised as “current cigarette smokers” in reply to a
particular questionnaire had to have reported smoking
cigarettes, and only cigarettes, in that and any previous reply.
This excludes all who had previously replied that they were using
any other type of
tobacco, or no tobacco. Likewise, those
classified as “former cigarette smokers” were either ex-smokers
in 1951 whose last habit involved only cigarettes, or current ciga-
rette smokers (defined as above) who had stopped. The terms
“never smoker” or “non-smoker” mean lifelong non-smoker—
that is, they exclude any respondent who had smoked on most
days for a year. Those who, despite reminders, failed (perhaps
because of illness) to complete a particular questionnaire could
generally be traced for mortality and so continued to be analysed
according to their previously reported smoking habits.

Causes of death
Causes were obtained for 98.9% of the deaths. The underlying
cause on the death certificate was classified according to ICD-7
(international classification of diseases, seventh revision) until
1978, then ICD-9 (except that “lung cancer” always excluded
pleural mesothelioma, and “pulmonary heart disease” included
death from myocardial degeneration or heart failure with men-
tion of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Until 1971
special inquiries of any mention of lung cancer were made, but
(perhaps because these men were themselves doctors) this rarely
changed the certified cause.14

Statistical methods

Standardised mortality rates
The main analyses of mortality in relation to smoking seek to
determine whether, among men in the same five year age group
(16 groups, from 20-24 years to 90-94 years, then ≥ 95 years)
and the same time period (either 10 five year or 50 one year
periods), the death rate is related to the previously reported
smoking habits. Apart from some directly standardised analyses
at ages 70-89,
indirect
standardisation (for age group and time period) to the “person
years” distribution of the whole population being considered.
From these indirectly standardised death rates, we calculated
relative risks.

this generally involves, as before,17

To assess the effects of smoking on mortality at ages 60 and
above for the cohort of men born in the 19th century and the
cohort born in the 20th century, the relative risks comparing
various categories of smokers with never smokers are calculated

separately within each cohort. (Thus, the relative risk is 1 for
non-smokers in both cohorts, irrespective of any changes over
time in the death rates for non-smokers.)

Survival curves
The proportions expected to survive from one age to another
are calculated by multiplying together the relevant five year age
specific survival probabilities. These probabilities are calculated
as exp( − 5R), where exp is the exponential function and R is the
annual death rate (deaths/person years) in that age range. (This
exponential approximation is of adequate accuracy for each age
range up to and including 90-94 years.)

When survival curves of smokers and non-smokers (or of
smokers, non-smokers, and ex-smokers) are to be compared to
assess the effects of tobacco, they have to be standardised for cal-
endar year. To do this, we calculated the death rate in each five
year age group by dividing the weighted sum of the numbers of
deaths in the relevant five year time periods by the similarly
weighted sum of the numbers of person years. (The weights are
proportional to the amount of statistical information contrib-
uted by that time period to the smoker versus never smoker
comparison in that age group; hence, this ignores periods with
no deaths or without any smokers in the relevant age group.)

Results

Mortality by smoking habit and cause of death
Table 1 shows mortality by smoking habit
for 11 major
categories of cause of death, and for all causes combined. In
these and all other analyses, current cigarette smokers are
restricted to those who in all their previous replies (including the
first, in 1951) reported smoking only cigarettes. Likewise, former
cigarette smokers are restricted to those who, before stopping,
had reported in all their previous replies smoking only cigarettes
(or who had stopped before 1951, having last smoked only
cigarettes).

As previously,17 lung cancer and chronic obstructive lung dis-
ease are closely related to continued cigarette smoking and to

the daily number of cigarettes smoked. For each of the other
nine categories of cause of death there are more moderate, but
again highly significant (each P < 0.0001), positive relations with
the continuation of cigarette smoking and with the daily number
smoked.

from “external”

Effects on overall mortality
How far, in this particular population, such relations between
smoking and mortality reflect cause and effect has been
discussed previously.17 23 Midway through the study, the results
from the 1978 questionnaire confirmed the well known associa-
tion between smoking and drinking,24 but showed little or no
relation between smoking and either obesity or blood pressure
(table 2), so these particular factors cannot help to account for
the excess vascular mortality among smokers. The excess
mortality
and
poisoning—among smokers is unlikely to be due chiefly to
smoking (although two men did die from fire because of smok-
ing in bed) but, rather, is likely to be due to other behavioural
factors with which smoking is associated, such as the heavy con-
sumption of alcohol or a willingness to take risks. Such external
causes, however, account for less than 3% of the overall excess
mortality among cigarette smokers. A quarter of the excess mor-
tality among smokers is accounted for by lung cancer and
chronic obstructive lung disease and another quarter by ischae-
mic heart disease; most of the rest involves other neoplastic, res-
piratory, or vascular diseases that could well be made more
probable (among the survivors at a given age) by smoking.

Some of the 11 relations in table 1 have been increased by
confounding, most notably with alcohol (which can increase the
risk of developing cirrhosis of the liver and cancers of the mouth,
pharynx, larynx, and oesophagus) and with personality (in the
case of accidents, injury, and poisoning). Confounding, however,
can act in two directions, as alcohol consumption—which is
higher among smokers than among non-smokers (table 2)—can
also decrease the risk of ischaemic heart disease and perhaps of

causality”—that is, some reduction in the apparent risk of death
among current smokers because of a tendency for people to give
up smoking after they begin to be affected by some life threaten-
ing condition (table 2), whether or not their illness was caused by
smoking.

When all 11 categories in table 1 are added together,
however, yielding overall mortality, the combined effects of all
these non-causal factors—acting to increase or decrease the
apparent hazards among smokers—are unlikely to have
influenced greatly the absolute difference between the overall
mortality rates of cigarette smokers and lifelong non-smokers.
This difference, we conclude, provides a reasonably quantitative
estimate of the extent to which, at particular ages, cigarette
smoking caused death in this population.

Trends over time: successive birth cohorts

19th and 20th century births
In table 3, the relations between smoking and mortality at ages
60 and over are shown separately for the cohort of men born late
in the 19th century and for the cohort born early in the 20th
century. (Restriction to ages 60 and over is necessary because the
study began in 1951, so for those born in the 19th century it pro-
vides little information on mortality at earlier ages.)

Cigarette smoking had become common among young men
in Britain by the end of the first world war (1914-1918) and
remained so for half a century,18 reinforced by the issue of low
cost cigarettes to young military conscripts from 1939. As a
result, men who were born in the first, second, and, particularly,
the third decade of the 20th century and were still smoking ciga-
rettes after the age of 60 had been smoking substantial numbers
throughout adult life. This would not have been as much the case
for men who were born in the last decades of the 19th century,
even if they too were smoking cigarettes after the age of 60.

The smoker versus non-smoker relative risks in table 3 are,
therefore, much more adverse for smokers born in the 20th cen-
tury than for those born earlier, particularly for cigarette smok-
ers. For the cohort born in the 19th century the cigarette smoker
versus non-smoker relative risk when they were over 60 years of
age was only 1.46 (excess mortality 46%), but for the cohort born
in the 20th century it was 2.19 (excess mortality 119%). For heavy
cigarette smokers (25 or more a day at their last reply) the
smoker versus non-smoker relative risk was 1.83 for the cohort
born in the 19th century and 2.61 for the cohort born in the
20th century, corresponding, respectively, to 83% and 161%
excess mortality among the smokers.

The patterns of survival from age 60 in these two birth
cohorts among lifelong non-smokers and among those who
smoked only cigarettes since 1951 are shown in figure 1, which
gives the proportions of 60 year olds who would be expected to
be still alive at ages 70, 80, 90, and 100. The substantial improve-
ment among non-smokers is apparent, as is the lack of substan-
improvement among smokers, corresponding to the
tial
increasing effects, from one century of birth to the next, of ciga-
rette smoking on overall mortality. The comparisons in table 3
and figure 1 involve only about a 20 year difference between the
times when the mortality rates at a given age are being
compared—for, although the median years of birth for all men in
the two cohorts differed by 26 years, the median years of birth of
those who died differed less.

1900-1930 births
Subdivision of the younger participants by decade of birth
(1900-1909, 1910-1919, or 1920-1929; only one was born in
1930) shows that, even among those born in the 20th century,
the hazards associated with cigarette smoking differ substantially
from one birth cohort to another (fig 2). For those born in the

first decade of the century the difference between cigarette
smokers and non-smokers in the probability of surviving from
age 35 to age 70 was only 18% (58% v 76% (corresponding to a
twofold death rate ratio)), but it was 28% (57% v 85% (a threefold
death rate ratio)) for those born in the third decade. This
comparison again involves only a 20 year time difference.

Trends over time: successive study decades
If we compare mortality at ages 70-89 during the five separate
decades of the study (1951-2001) then the effects of a 40 year
time difference (1950s v 1990s) can be studied, as the ages of the
original respondents varied from only 21 to 100. Some 2000
men were already aged 70-89 at the start of the study, and some
4000 of the younger respondents eventually survived to reach
their 70th birthday during the fifth decade of the study. Thus, in
each study decade we can observe the death rates of men in their
70s and 80s and can calculate the probability that, at the age spe-
cific death rates prevailing in that particular decade, a 70 year old
man would survive to age 90 (table 4).

Over the five decades there is both a progressive reduction in
the mortality of elderly never smokers and, counterbalancing
this, a progressive maturing of the epidemic of the effects of
cigarette smoking on mortality in old age. Table 4 shows a halv-
ing of the standardised mortality rate at ages 70-89 among non-
smokers and almost a tripling of their probability of surviving
from age 70 to age 90, which was 12% at the non-smoker death
rates of the 1950s and 33% at those of the 1990s. (The mean
years of birth for those who died at ages 70-89 in the 1950s and
the 1990s were, respectively, 1875 and 1915.)

These reductions in mortality of the lifelong non-smokers
were presumably due both to prevention of, and, particularly, to
improvements in the treatment of, various diseases in elderly
people. (For example, one of the present authors who is a
participant in the study acquired a pacemaker 10 years ago.) But,
among successive birth cohorts of cigarette smokers the increas-

ing effects of cigarette smoking completely eliminated the great
reductions in overall mortality at ages 70-89 that were occurring
among non-smokers (table 4). Among those born in about the
1870s and observed at ages 70-89 during the 1950s, the cigarette
smoker versus non-smoker death rate ratio was only 1.16 (92.9/
80.1), whereas for those born in about the 1910s and observed at
ages 70-89 during the 1990s the death rate ratio was 2.83
(113.1/39.9).

Hazards among cigarette smokers born 1900-1930

By decade of birth
For
those born in 1900-1909, annual mortality among
non-smokers was, both in middle and in old age, about half that
among cigarette smokers. (These twofold death rate ratios are
calculated from the logarithms of the probabilities of surviving
from 35-70, 70-80, and 80-90 in figure 2 (top graph).) Taking, as
before, the excess overall mortality among these smokers as an
approximate measure of the excess mortality actually caused by
smoking, this twofold ratio indicates that about half of the
persistent cigarette smokers born in 1900-1909 would eventually
be killed by their habit.

For those born in 1920-1929 the probability of death in mid-
dle age (35-69) was 15% in non-smokers and 43% in cigarette
smokers, corresponding to a threefold death rate ratio

Fig 3 Survival from age 35 for continuing cigarette smokers and lifelong
non-smokers among UK male doctors born 1900-1930, with percentages alive at
each decade of age

(calculated from the logarithms of the survival probabilities in
figure 2 (bottom graph)). Extrapolation of the trends in table 4
suggests that these men will also have about a threefold smoker
versus non-smoker death rate ratio in old age (70-89). This indi-
cates that about two thirds of the persistent cigarette smokers
born in the 1920s would eventually be killed by their habit.

Over whole 30 year period
Figure 3 averages the findings in figure 2 for all men born in
1900-1930, distinguishing between lifelong non-smokers and
continuing cigarette smokers. (Among the latter, the median age
when they began smoking was 18, and at the start of the study
their median age was 36 and their mean self reported cigarette
consumption was 18 a day.) The results suggest a shift of about
10 years between the overall survival patterns of the continuing
cigarette smokers and the lifelong non-smokers in this particular
generation. That is not to say that all such smokers died about 10
years earlier than they would otherwise have done: some were

not killed by their habit, but about half were, thereby losing on
average more than 10 years of non-smoker life expectancy.
Indeed, some of those killed by tobacco must have lost a few
decades of life.

Mortality on stopping smoking
A high proportion of the doctors who had been smoking in
1951 stopped during the first decades of this study, after it had
become generally accepted by the British medical profession
that cigarette smoking was a cause of most of the UK mortality
from lung cancer.25 26 We can, therefore, examine mortality for
some decades after stopping smoking (table 5). As the benefits of
stopping cigarette smoking can be assessed directly only in a
population where the hazards of continuing to smoke cigarettes
are already substantial, our main analyses of cessation are again
restricted to the men born in 1900-1930. Among them, those
who stopped and those who continued smoking differed little in
obesity and blood pressure and differed only moderately in
mean alcohol consumption (table 2).

But, although many stopped when still relatively young and
healthy during the 1950s and ’60s, some who stopped in later
middle age did so because they were already ill (table 2). This
removal of some imminent deaths of smokers from the current
to the ex-smoker category reduces the apparent mortality
among current smokers and may substantially inflate the appar-
ent mortality of recent ex-smokers. For example, mortality at
ages 55-64 among those who stopped smoking at ages 55-64 was
spuriously somewhat greater than mortality among continuing
smokers in that age group. Although the death rates for
ex-smokers in table 5 are given only for the age ranges after the
range in which smoking stopped, they too may still be somewhat
affected by such reverse causality (see above for definition).

Mortality by age stopped smoking
Nevertheless, table 5 shows a steady trend in mortality at older
ages (65-74 or 75-84) between lifelong non-smokers, ex-cigarette
smokers who stopped at ages 35-44, 45-54, or 55-64, and

continuing cigarette smokers. Thus, stopping earlier is associated
with greater benefit.

Mortality for ex-smokers is shown in figure 4, which (bearing
in mind the possible relevance of reverse causality) indicates that
even a 60 year old cigarette smoker could gain at least three years
of life expectancy by stopping (fig 4 (bottom graph)). In figure 4,
the mortality rates that would be seen at ages 60-64 among those
who stop at about age 60 had to be interpolated (half way
between the smoker and non-smoker rates), as they could not be
assessed directly (partly because of reverse causality and partly
because in this study there was often a delay of a few years before
the next questionnaire arrived and cessation could be reported).
This, however, makes little difference to the long term survival
differences between continuing and ex-cigarette smokers.

Those who stopped at about age 50 gained about six years of
life expectancy; those who stopped at about age 40 gained about
nine years; and those who stopped before middle age gained
about 10 years and had a pattern of survival similar to that of
men who had never smoked (fig 4 (top graph)).

The mean cigarette consumption in 1951 (or when last
smoked, if this was before 1951) was similar to that in continuing
smokers for those who stopped at 45-64 and was only slightly
lower for those who stopped at 25-34 or 35-44. Thus, the latter
had, on average, had substantial exposure to cigarette smoking
for about 20 years before giving up the habit, yet they still
avoided most of the excess mortality that they would have
suffered if they had continued to smoke.

Lung cancer mortality
Table 6 describes the age specific mortality just from lung cancer
among the same non-smokers, ex-smokers, and current cigarette
smokers, comparing the observed numbers with the numbers
that would have been expected if they had had the age specific
lung cancer death rates of lifelong non-smokers. For statistical
stability, these lung cancer death rates for non-smokers are taken
from a much larger prospective study, which began in 1981 in
the United States (see footnote to table 6).19 At these US rates,
19.5 lung cancer deaths at ages 35-84 would have been expected
among the lifelong non-smokers in the present study, and 18
were observed, which is a reasonably good match (mortality ratio
0.9). For the current cigarette smokers the corresponding
mortality ratio was 15.9 (13.7 expected and 218 observed).

There was a steady trend in this lung cancer mortality ratio
between lifelong non-smokers, ex-smokers who had stopped at
25-34 (see table 6 footnote), 35-44, 45-54, or 55-64, and continu-
ing smokers. This trend confirms the findings from case-control
studies27 that there is substantial protection even for those who
stop at 55-64, and progressively greater protection for those who
stop earlier. None the less, those who had smoked until about 40
years of age before they stopped had some excess risk of lung
cancer at older ages.

By combining the penultimate columns of tables 5 and 6, we
calculated the annual lung cancer mortality rates per 1000 con-
tinuing cigarette smokers at ages 45-54 through to 75-84 to be
0.6 (that is, 8.5×33/487), 1.8, 6.2 and 8.7 respectively. At ages
45-64 these rates are somewhat lower than in the general UK
population born around 1915, which includes a mixture of non-
smokers, ex-smokers, and current smokers, and at ages 65-84
they are similar. Hence, the lung cancer death rates among male
cigarette smokers must have been even greater in the general
UK population than in this study.

Discussion

Emergence of full hazards for persistent cigarette smokers
In many populations nowadays the consumption of substantial
numbers of cigarettes begins in early adult life and then contin-
ues. But the full eventual effects of this on mortality in middle
and old age can be studied directly only in a population, such as
British males, in which cigarette consumption by young adults
was already substantial when those who are now old were young.
The generation of men born in Britain during the first few
the 20th century is probably the first major
decades of
population in the world of which this is true. Daily cigarette con-
sumption per UK adult (one, two, four, and six a day in 1905,

1915, 1933, and 1941 respectively—mostly consumed by men)
was three times as great in the second world war (1939-45) as in
the first world war (1914-18).28 Hence, men born in the 1920s
may well have had even more intense early exposure than those
born a decade or two earlier, as in the United Kingdom
widespread military conscription of 18 year old men, which
began again in 1939 and continued for decades, routinely
involved provision of low cost cigarettes to the conscripts. This
established in many 18 year olds a persistent habit of smoking
substantial numbers of manufactured cigarettes, which could
well cause the death of more than half of those who continued.

Many, however, avoided the greater part of the risk by
stopping smoking: although 70% of all UK males born around
1920 were smoking manufactured cigarettes in 1950 (at ages
25-34), only 29% were still doing so in 1985 (at ages 50-64).28
Hence, as UK males born in 1900-1930 reached extreme old age
at the end of the 20th century—or, for those born in the 1920s, in
the early years of the 21st century—they provide the first oppor-
tunity to assess directly the hazards of persistent cigarette smok-
ing and, correspondingly (in comparison with those who
continued), the long term benefits of cessation.

Trends in mortality from smoking, and trends among
non-smokers
The experience of the 24 000 men in this study who were born
in 1900-1930 shows persistent cigarette smoking to be more
hazardous than had appeared in previous analyses of this, or any
other, study (figs 2 and 3), and shows correspondingly greater
long term benefits from cessation (fig 4). Those who continued
to smoke cigarettes lost, on average, about 10 years of life
compared with non-smokers, while those who stopped at around
age 60, 50, 40, or 30 gained, respectively, about 3, 6, 9, or 10 years
life expectancy compared with those who continued.
of
Moreover, among those born in 1900-1930 the absolute
difference between cigarette smokers and non-smokers in the
probability of death in middle age increased from 18% (42% v
24%, a twofold death rate ratio) for those born in the first decade
of the century to 28% (43% v 15%, a threefold death rate ratio)
for those born in the 1920s (fig 2).

In old age (table 4) the difference between cigarette smokers
and non-smokers in the probability of a 70 year old surviving to
90 increased from only 2% (10% v 12%) at the death rates seen
during the first decade of the study (among men born, on aver-
age, around 1875) to 26% (7% v 33%) at the death rates seen
during the fifth decade of the study (among men born, on aver-
age, around 1915), indicating that the corresponding difference
will be still greater for those born in the 1920s. If so, then about
two thirds of the persistent cigarette smokers among them would
be killed by their habit. Both in middle and in old age, the

increasing difference between the mortality of cigarette smokers
and non-smokers arises because the large progressive decrease
in the mortality of non-smokers in recent decades has, for the
the
counterbalanced by
cigarette smokers, been wholly
increasing death rate ratio of smokers versus non-smokers.

Applicability of findings
Our 1994 report of the 40 year findings concluded that “Results
from the first 20 years of this study, and of other studies at that
time [the 1970s], substantially underestimated the hazards of
long term use of tobacco.17 It now [in the 1990s] seems that about
half of all regular cigarette smokers will eventually be killed by
their habit.” Ten years later, the 50 year findings show that for the
continuing cigarette smokers in this study who were born in the
first, second, and third decades of the 20th century, the eventual
risks vary from about one half to about two thirds (fig 2),
although the mortality rates among them from lung cancer were,
if anything, somewhat lower than among their contemporaries
in the general UK population who smoked.

It is a new finding that the risk of being killed by tobacco can
be as great as two thirds, but this applies directly only to the haz-
ards suffered by this particular group of professional British men
during the past half century. If these results are to be used indi-
rectly to help predict the risks that male, female, rich, poor, Brit-
ish, and non-British populations of persistent cigarette smokers
are likely to face over the next half century, then it may be more
appropriate to retain the previous semiquantitative conclusion
that “smoking kills about one half.” For, although we have found
a population in which persistent cigarette smoking killed some-
what more than half (fig 2), there may be other circumstances in
which it kills somewhat less than half.

Changes in cigarette manufacture might somewhat limit the
eventual hazards, as might favourable changes in the prevention
or treatment of neoplastic, respiratory or, particularly, vascular
disease. But, unless such changes produce much bigger propor-
tional reductions in mortality among smokers than among non-
smokers, they will not make the age specific smoker versus non-
smoker death rate ratios much less than 2, so the statement that
about half are killed by their habit will not be an exaggeration.
Moreover, the death rate ratios in table 5 (which underlie figure
3) are actually somewhat greater than 2, and the tendency in
some populations for intense cigarette smoking to be established
before the median age of 18 that was seen in this study can only
exacerbate the eventual risks.
statement

in many very different
populations the future risk of death from persistent cigarette
smoking will still be about one half is therefore a reasonable one,
and the results thus far in a widening range of studies in other

*Among US male non-smokers in the five year range starting at a given age, the annual lung cancer death rate is taken to be 11.2 times the fourth power of (age/1000). This is based on a large
US prospective study in the 1980s, but similar results were seen in a large US prospective study in the 1960s, indicating that US non-smoker lung cancer death certification rates have been
approximately constant over the past few decades.19
†Total for ex-cigarette smokers who stopped at ages 25-34 is observed 7, expected 4.7; mortality ratio is 1.5.

What is already known on this topic

About half of all persistent cigarette smokers are killed by
their habit—a quarter while still in middle age (35-69 years)

After a large increase in cigarette smoking by young people,
the full effects on national mortality rates can take more
than 50 years to mature

British men born in the first few decades of the 20th
century could be the first population in the world in which
the full long term hazards of cigarette smoking, and the
corresponding benefits of stopping, can be assessed directly

What this study adds

Among the particular generation of men born around
1920, cigarette smoking tripled the age specific mortality
rates

Among British men born 1900-1909, cigarette smoking
approximately doubled the age specific mortality rates in
both middle and old age

Longevity has been improving rapidly for non-smokers, but
not for men who continued smoking cigarettes

Cessation at age 50 halved the hazard; cessation at 30
avoided almost all of it

On average, cigarette smokers die about 10 years younger
than non-smokers

Stopping at age 60, 50, 40, or 30 gains, respectively, about 3,
6, 9, or 10 years of life expectancy

China29–31 and India32 33 seem consistent with it (as long as the
prolonged delay between cause and full effect is properly appre-
ciated). If so, then on current worldwide smoking patterns
(whereby about 30% of young adults become smokers) there will
be about one billion tobacco deaths in this century, unless there
is widespread cessation.34–36 For, with low tar cigarettes still
involving substantial hazards,37 the quantitative conclusion from
this study that seems most likely to be robust is that, even among
middle aged smokers, cessation is effective and cessation at ear-
lier ages is even more so.
