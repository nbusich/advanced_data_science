Environmental tobacco smoke and tobacco related
mortality in a prospective study of Californians, 1960-98
James E Enstrom, Geoffrey C Kabat

Abstract

Objective To measure the relation between
environmental tobacco smoke, as estimated by
smoking in spouses, and long term mortality from
tobacco related disease.
Design Prospective cohort study covering 39 years.
Setting Adult population of California, United States.
Participants 118 094 adults enrolled in late 1959 in
the American Cancer Society cancer prevention study
(CPS I), who were followed until 1998. Particular focus
is on the 35 561 never smokers who had a spouse in
the study with known smoking habits.
Main outcome measures Relative risks and 95%
confidence intervals for deaths from coronary heart
disease, lung cancer, and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease related to smoking in spouses and
active cigarette smoking.
Results For participants followed from 1960 until 1998
the age adjusted relative risk (95% confidence interval)
for never smokers married to ever smokers compared
with never smokers married to never smokers was 0.94
(0.85 to 1.05) for coronary heart disease, 0.75 (0.42 to
1.35) for lung cancer, and 1.27 (0.78 to 2.08) for
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease among 9619
men, and 1.01 (0.94 to 1.08), 0.99 (0.72 to 1.37), and
1.13 (0.80 to 1.58), respectively, among 25 942 women.
No significant associations were found for current or
former exposure to environmental tobacco smoke
before or after adjusting for seven confounders and
before or after excluding participants with pre-existing
disease. No significant associations were found during
the shorter follow up periods of 1960-5, 1966-72,
1973-85, and 1973-98.
Conclusions The results do not support a causal
relation between environmental tobacco smoke and
tobacco related mortality, although they do not rule
out a small effect. The association between exposure
to environmental tobacco smoke and coronary heart
disease and lung cancer may be considerably weaker
than generally believed.

Introduction

Several major reviews have determined that exposure to
environmental tobacco smoke increases the relative risk
of coronary heart disease, based primarily on compar-
ing never smokers married to smokers with never smok-
ers married to never smokers. The American Heart

Association, the California Environmental Protection
Agency, and the US surgeon general have concluded
that the increase in coronary heart disease risk due to
environmental
tobacco smoke is 30% (relative risk
1.30).1–3 Meta-analyses of epidemiological studies have
reported summary relative risks (95% confidence inter-
vals) of 1.30 (1.22 to 1.38), 1.25 (1.17 to 1.32), and 1.25
(1.17 to 1.33) for coronary heart disease4–6 and 1.23 (1.13
to 1.35) and 1.23 (1.13 to 1.34) for lung cancer,7 8 similar
to the 1.20 found by the California Environmental Pro-
tection Agency and the US surgeon general.2 3 The US
Environmental Protection Agency has classified envi-
ronmental tobacco smoke as a known human carcino-
gen.7 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, primarily
asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema, has been associated
with exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, but the
evidence for increased mortality is sparse.2 3

so strong that

Although these reviews come to similar conclu-
sions, the association between environmental tobacco
smoke and tobacco related diseases is still controversial
owing to several
limitations in the epidemiological
studies.9–14 Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke
is difficult to measure quantitatively and therefore has
been approximated by
reported estimates,
primarily smoking history in spouses. Confounding by
the
active cigarette smoking is
association with environmental tobacco smoke can
only be evaluated among never smokers. The relation
between tobacco related diseases and environmental
tobacco smoke may be influenced by misclassification
of some smokers as never smokers, misclassification of
exposure status to environmental tobacco smoke, and
several potential confounders. It is also unclear how
the reported increased risk of coronary heart disease
due to environmental tobacco smoke could be so close
to the increased risk due to active smoking (30% and
70%, respectively), since environmental tobacco smoke
is much more dilute than actively inhaled smoke.

Most epidemiological studies have found that envi-
ronmental tobacco smoke has a positive but not statis-
tically significant relation to coronary heart disease
and lung cancer. Meta-analyses have combined these
inconclusive results to produce statistically significant
summary relative risks.4–8 However, there are problems
inherent in using meta-analysis to establish a causal
relation.9–14 The epidemiological data are subject to the
limitations described above. They have not been
collected in a standardised way, and some relative risks

have been inappropriately combined. Because it is
more likely that positive associations get published,
unpublished negative results could reduce the sum-
mary relative risks. Also, the meta-analyses of coronary
heart disease omitted the published negative results
from the large American Cancer Society cancer
prevention study (CPS I).10 11 We have extended the fol-
low up for the California participants in this cohort,

analysed the relation between environmental tobacco
smoke and tobacco related diseases, and addressed
concerns about this study.

the adults up to September 1972 and obtained death
certificates for most of those known dead.

height on the questionnaire confirmed that over 99%
of the respondents had been accurately located.

Follow up
Long term follow up was undertaken at the University
of California at Los Angeles on all 118 094
participants from California. This is described in detail
elsewhere and summarised in table 1.18 The partici-
pants were matched several times with the California
death file and the social security death index on the
basis of their name and other identifying variables.18 19
Overall, 79 437 deaths were identified up to 31
December 1998, and the underlying cause was
obtained from the California death file and death cer-
tificates for 93% (73 876) of these deaths.

Participants were also matched with information
given on their California driver’s licence, based prima-
rily on name, date of birth, and height. We obtained the
address given during the 1990s for 21 897 participants
who were not known as dead as of 1999, and these par-
ticipants were assumed to be alive in 1999. Of the
remaining participants in the study’s master database,
6845 were withdrawn from further follow up as of Sep-
tember 1972 because their complete name was not
retained, and 9915 were lost to follow up as of 1999
because their vital status was unknown.

To assess the current status of surviving cohort
members,
in mid-1999 we sent out a two page
questionnaire on smoking and lifestyle to those
participants with an address for 1995 or later on their
driver’s licence. Overall, 2290 of 5275 men (43.4%)
and 4869 of 10 738 women (45.3%) completed the
questionnaire. Responses to name, date of birth, and

The follow up period was from time of entry to the
study (1 January to 31 March 1960) until death,
withdrawal (date last known alive), or end of follow up
(31 December 1998). The participants were aged 30-96
years at enrolment. We excluded the few person years
of observation and the 36 deaths during 1959. The
underlying cause of each death was assigned according
to the international classification of diseases (seventh,
eighth, or ninth revisions). Coronary heart disease was
defined as 420 (ICD-7) during 1960-7, 410-4 (ICD-8)
during 1968-78, and 410-4 (ICD-9) during 1979-98,
lung cancer was defined as 162-3 (ICD-7), 162 (ICD-8),
and 162 (ICD-9), and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease was defined as 241, 500-2, and 527.1 (ICD-7),
490-3 (ICD-8), and 490-6 (ICD-9). For the analysis of
environmental tobacco smoke we selected the 35 561
participants who had never smoked as of 1959 and
who had a spouse in the study with known smoking
habits.

Statistical analysis
The independent variable used for analysis was
exposure to environmental tobacco smoke based on
smoking status of the spouse in 1959, 1965, and 1972.
Never smokers married to current or former smokers
were compared with never smokers married to never
smokers. The 1959 never smokers were defined as
those who had never smoked any form of tobacco as of
1959. The 1965 never smokers were defined as 1959
never smokers who did not smoke cigarettes as of
1965. The 1972 never smokers were defined as 1959

never smokers who did not smoke cigarettes as of 1965
and 1972. The 1959/1999 never smokers were defined
as 1959 never smokers who had never smoked
cigarettes as of 1999. Never smokers married to a cur-
rent smoker were subdivided into categories according
to the smoking status of their spouse: 1-9, 10-19, 20,
21-39, ≥ 40 cigarettes consumed per day for men and
women, with the addition of pipe or cigar usage for
women. Former smokers were considered as an
additional category.

We calculated the age adjusted relative risk of death
and 95% confidence interval as a function of smoking
status of the spouse by using Cox proportional hazards
regression.18 20 A fully adjusted relative risk was
calculated by using a model that included age and
seven potential confounders at baseline: race (white,
non-white), education level ( < 12, 12, > 12 years), exer-
cise (none or slight, moderate, heavy), body mass index
( < 20, 20-22.99, 23-25.99, 26-29.99, ≥ 30), urbanisation
(five population sizes), fruit or fruit juice intake (0-2,
3-4, 5-7 days a week), and health status (good, fair,
poor,
for all
sick). Analyses were carried out
participants and for healthy participants (those with no
history of cancer, heart disease, or stroke at baseline).
The relative risk was also calculated for current
cigarette smokers (cigarettes only) as a function of
number of cigarettes consumed per day for the entire
cohort.18 For reference, the age adjusted death rate has
been calculated by cause of death for all never
smokers.18

Results

for 1959 never

The personal and lifestyle characteristics and follow up
status
smokers were relatively
independent of their spouse’s smoking status (tables 2
and 3). Also, the baseline characteristics of the 1999
respondents in 1959 were similar to those for all
participants in 1959, except for a younger age at enrol-
ment. Although heavily censored by age, the 1999
respondents
seemed reasonably representative of
survivors. Race, education, exercise, height, weight, and
intake had also remained largely unchanged
fruit
among the 1999 respondents
since 1959. The
proportion of participants who had withdrawn as of
1972, were lost as of 1999, or had an unknown cause of
death was not related to the smoking status of spouses.
However, widowhood (widowed as of 1999) increased
substantially with the level of smoking in the spouse.

The smoking status of spouses as of 1959 was
related to three self reported measures of exposure to
environmental tobacco smoke as of 1999 (table 4). Par-
ticularly for women, there was a clear relation between
smoking status of spouses as of 1959 and self reported
measures in 1999 of having lived with a smoker, having
lived with a smoking spouse, and a positive answer to
the question “In your work or daily life, are (were) you
regularly exposed to cigarette smoke from others?”
Also, the percentage of participants currently married
as of 1999 declined substantially with the smoking sta-
tus of the spouse, owing to increased widowhood.

smoking in spouses. This bias produces a measured
relative risk that is greater than the true relative risk,
but by a negligible amount for this level of bias.8 13

Misclassification of exposure and smoking status
Although there was substantial misclassification of
environmental tobacco smoke exposure status from
1959 to 1999, it was less for those never smokers aged
50 or over at enrolment (see table 4), never smokers
defined in 1972 (data not shown), and never smokers
defined in 1999 (see table 5). Misclassification of expo-
sure status produces a measured relative risk that is
closer to 1.0 than the true relative risk.8 13 The extent of
misclassification from 1959 to 1999 could not obscure
a true association with a relative risk of about 1.3, if it
exists, among women, but it could largely obscure this
association among men. However, this level of misclas-
sification, which is based on the changes that occurred
over 40 years among the younger than average 1999
respondents, exaggerates the true level of misclassifica-
tion that occurred among the cohort as a whole,
particularly during short follow up periods.

Essentially all 1959 never smokers remained never
smokers on the basis of smoking status reported in
1965, 1972, and 1999 (table 6). Of those who reported
a history of smoking in 1999, most had smoked no
more than 10 cigarettes per day for a few years, and
most had quit smoking before 1960. This indicates
only a small degree of misclassification of smoking sta-
tus. Some bias exists in the misclassification of smoking
status among the 1959 never smokers, because the
percentage who smoked in the 1965 and 1972 surveys
was greatest among those with the highest levels of

Effect of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke
Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke was not
significantly associated with the death rate for coronary
heart disease,
lung cancer, or chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease in men or women (tables 7 and 8).
This was true for all 1959 never smokers and 1959
never smokers aged 50 or over at enrolment followed
during 1960-98 and for 1972 never smokers followed
during 1973-98. The relative risks were slightly
reduced after adjustment
seven confounders.
Results were essentially unchanged among the healthy
participants only (data not shown). The relative risks
were consistent with 1.0 for virtually every level of
exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, current or
former. Only the relative risks for chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease suggested an association. An
environmental tobacco smoke index based on seven or
eight levels of smoking in a spouse yielded a relative
risk of about 1.0 for each level of change and no
suggestion of a dose-response trend.

for

In addition, analyses for coronary heart disease
were performed for three short follow up periods with
presumably smaller misclassification errors. All relative
risks for coronary heart disease were consistent with
1.0 for the follow up periods of 1960-5, 1966-72, and
1973-85 for never smokers defined as of 1959, 1965,
and 1972 (table 9). In particular, the relative risk for
current smoking in a spouse was not increased, and

there were no trends based on the environmental
tobacco smoke index.

As expected, there was a strong, positive dose-
response relation between active cigarette smoking
and deaths from coronary heart disease, lung cancer,
and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease during
1960-98 (table 1010). These relative risks were
consistent with those for the full CPS I cohort until
1972.15 17 As it is generally considered that exposure to
environmental tobacco smoke is roughly equivalent to
smoking one cigarette per day,4 we extrapolated the
relative risk due to exposure to environmental tobacco
smoke from the relative risks
smoking 1-9
cigarettes per day. These extrapolated relative risks
were about 1.03 for coronary heart disease and about
1.20 for lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmo-
nary disease. Based on these findings, exposure to
environmental
tobacco smoke could not plausibly
cause a 30% increase in risk of coronary heart disease
in this cohort, although a 20% increase in risk of lung
cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
could not be ruled out.

Discussion

On the basis of our findings from the long term follow
up of the California cohort of the cancer prevention
study (CPS I), the association between exposure to
environmental tobacco smoke and coronary heart dis-

ease and lung cancer may be considerably weaker than
generally believed. Although participants in CPS I are
not a representative sample of the US population,
never smokers in this cohort had a total death rate that
was close to that of US white never smokers.21 Further-
more, the relative risks were based on comparisons
within the cohort and should be valid. Although the
participants’ total exposure to smoking in a spouse was
affected by the substantial extent of smoking cessation
since 1959,18 this did not affect the relative compari-
sons. Also, the relative risks during short follow up
periods, with limited cessation, were similar to the long
term risks.

Strengths of study
CPS I has several important strengths: long established
value as a prospective epidemiological study, large size,
extensive baseline data on smoking and potential con-
founders, extensive follow up data, and excellent long
term follow up. None of the other cohort studies on
environmental tobacco smoke has more strengths, and
none has presented as many detailed results. Consider-
ing these strengths as a whole, the CPS I cohort is one
of the most valuable samples for studying the relation
between environmental tobacco smoke and mortality.
Concern has been expressed that smoking status of
the spouse as of 1959 does not accurately reflect total
exposure to environmental tobacco smoke because
so much exposure to non-residential
there was

environmental tobacco smoke at that time.6 The 1999
questionnaire showed that
the smoking status of
spouses was directly related to a history of total expo-
sure to environmental tobacco smoke. It also showed
that the extent of misclassification of exposure was not
sufficient
to obscure a true association between
environmental tobacco smoke and coronary heart dis-
ease among women (see tables 4 and 5).

Our methodology and results are fully described
because of concern that the earlier analysis of coronary
heart disease in CPS I 10 was flawed by author bias
owing to funding by the tobacco industry.4 Our results
for coronary heart disease and lung cancer are consist-
ent with those of most of the other individual studies
including the
on environmental
results for coronary heart disease and lung cancer in
the full CPS I.10 16 Moreover, when our results are
included in a meta-analysis of all results for coronary
heart disease, the summary relative risks for current
and ever exposure to environmental tobacco smoke
are reduced to about 1.05, indicating a weak relation.

tobacco smoke,4–8

Widowhood was strongly correlated with smoking
status of spouses, owing to the reduced survival of
smokers. Since widowers have higher death rates than
married people,22 23 controlling for widowhood would
be expected to reduce the relative risks in this and
other studies of smoking in spouses. The precise effect
of widowhood due to smoking in spouses still needs to
be determined, but it may partially explain the positive
relative risks found in other cohorts.

Conclusion
The results of the California CPS I cohort do not sup-
port a causal relation between exposure to environ-

What is already known on this topic

Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is
generally believed to increase the risk of coronary
heart disease and lung cancer among never
smokers by about 25%

This increased risk, based primarily on
meta-analysis, is still controversial due to
methodological problems

What this study adds

In a large study of Californians followed for 40
years, environmental tobacco smoke was not
associated with coronary heart disease or lung
cancer mortality at any level of exposure

These findings suggest that the effects of
environmental tobacco smoke, particularly for
coronary heart disease, are considerably smaller
than generally believed

Active cigarette smoking was confirmed as a
strong, dose related risk factor for coronary heart
disease, lung cancer, and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease

mental tobacco smoke and tobacco related mortality,
although they do not rule out a small effect. Given the
limitations of the underlying data in this and the other
studies of environmental tobacco smoke and the small
size of the risk, it seems premature to conclude that
environmental
tobacco smoke causes death from
coronary heart disease and lung cancer.

We thank Lawrence Garfinkel and Clark W Heath Jr (former
vice presidents for epidemiology and statistics, American
Cancer Society) for facilitating the extended follow up of CPS I
and for making helpful comments and suggestions and Saman
Assefi and Parveen Sra for technical assistance.
Contributors: JEE conceived the study and obtained funding,
conducted the extended follow up, analysed the data, and
drafted the manuscript; he will act as guarantor for the paper.
GCK contributed to the follow up questionnaire, advised on the
data analysis and interpretation, and contributed extensively to
the manuscript.
Funding: The American Cancer Society initiated CPS I in 1959,
conducted follow up until 1972, and has maintained the original
database. Extended follow up until 1997 was conducted at the
University of California at Los Angeles with initial support from
the Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program, a University of
California research organisation funded by the Proposition 99
cigarette surtax (www.ucop.edu/srphome/trdrp). After continu-
from the Tobacco-Related Disease Research
ing support
Program was denied, follow up through 1999 and data analysis
were conducted at University of California at Los Angeles with
support from the Center for Indoor Air Research, a 1988-99

research organisation that received funding primarily from US
tobacco companies.24
Competing interests: In recent years JEE has received funds
originating from the tobacco industry for his tobacco related
epidemiological research because it has been impossible for
him to obtain equivalent funds from other sources. GCK never
received funds originating from the tobacco industry until last
year, when he conducted an epidemiological review for a law
firm which has several tobacco companies as clients. He has
served as a consultant to the University of California at Los
Angeles for this paper. JEE and GCK have no other competing
interests. They are both lifelong non-smokers whose primary
interest is an accurate determination of the health effects of
tobacco.
