Abstract

Cigarette smoke is associated to severe chronic diseases. The most harmful

components of cigarette smoke derive from the combustion process, which are

significantly reduced in the electronic cigarette aerosol, thus providing a valid option

in harm reduction strategies. To develop safer products, it is therefore necessary to

screen electronic cigarette liquids (e-liquids) to meet high safety standards defined by

government regulations. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence

of metal- and plastic-derived contaminants in four different commercial e-liquids with

high concentration of nicotine and their cytotoxic effect in normal human bronchial

epithelial cells by a number of in vitro assays, in comparison with the 1R6F reference

cigarette, using an air-liquid interface (ALI) exposure system. Moreover, we evaluated

the effect of aerosol exposure on oxidative stress by measuring the production of

reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial potential. Our

results showed no

contaminants in all e-liquids and a significantly reduced cytotoxic effect of e-liquid

aerosol compared to cigarette smoke as well as a maintained mitochondria integrity.

Moreover, no production of reactive oxygen species was detected with e-cigarette

aerosol. In conclusion, these results support the reduced toxicity potential of e-cigs

compared to tobacco cigarettes in an in vitro model resembling real

life smoke
