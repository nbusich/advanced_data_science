SUMMARY 
The relationship of environmental tobacco smoke to lung cancer risk in lifelong non-smokers is commonly 
studied using marriage to a smoker as the index of exposure. As smokers tend to marry smokers, relative risk 
estimates will  be biased  if some current or former smokers are misclassified as lifelong non-smokers. This 
paper  shows how  various factors affect  the magnitude of  the bias  and  describes a method  for  obtaining 
misclassification-adjusted relative  risk  estimates. Application  of  the method  to  U.S.  and  Asian  data for 
women  suggests  misclassification  is  an  important  determinant  of  the  slight  excess  risk  observed  in 
non-smokers married to smokers. Reasons why our conclusions differ from those of  others are discussed, as 
are other difficulties in  interpreting  the association between spousal smoking and lung cancer  risk. 

1.  INTRODUCTION 

Error in the variables studied can bias the relationship of a risk factor to a disease. In 2 x 2 tables, 
random  misclassification  of  exposure  or  disease  biases  relative  risk  (RR)  estimate  towards 
unity.'-3  How  the  bias  relates  to  the  misclassification  rate,  and  the  disease  and  exposure 
frequency has been de~cribed.~ Additional information on accuracy of exposure data can be used 
to obtain unbiased  RR  estimates.' 

Random  misclassification  of  exposure  understates

misclassification of  confounding variables may  not. How misclassification affects RR estimates

errors in the  confounder,  adjustment  has  little effect. Even for  smaller ( -   10 per  cent) errors, 
about half the confounding effect remains after adjustment. Tzonou et aL6 note that 'Generally, in 
the presence  of  strong risk  factors which have potentially  large confounding  effects and which 
may  have  been  imprecisely  measured,  the  etiological  significance of  factors  observed  to  be 
relatively weakly associated with disease must  be treated  with caution.

Since 1981, the possible association of  lung cancer with environmental  tobacco smoke (ETS) 
exposure has been extensively studied. Since this association, if it existed, would be much weaker 
than that with active smoking, and since it is hard to quantify precisely the many aspects of active 
smoking  correlated  with  risk,  ETS  studies  usually  consider  only  lifelong  non-smokers.  The 
exposure index usually used, and that for which an association has been claimed,'.'

a smoker, there being far more data for females than males. Some 10 years agog one of  us (PNL) 
pointed  out that, as smokers tend to marry smokers, misclassification of  some current or former

smokers as Iifelong non-smokers would bias the spousal smoking RR. Since then many attempts 
have been made to quantify the bias,’.  ’* ‘ O - ”   with conflicting conclusions about its importance. 
This paper reviews the issue of  bias from smoking misclassification in ETS/lung cancer studies. 
Section 2 considers misclassification in a 2 x 2 table assuming no true ETS effect, and describes 
the relationship of  the observed spousal smoking/lung cancer association to various factors and 
assumptions. It is shown that misclassification of  smokers as non-smokers causes much greater 
bias than misclassification, either of  non-smokers as smokers or of  spousal smoking. Restricting 
attention  to  misclassification of  smoking subjects, Section 3 considers the possibility  of  a true 
ETS effect,  acting  multiplicatively or  additively with  active  smoking. It  also  reveals  errors  in 
published methodologies for bias adjustment.”  l o  Section 4 allows for different misclassification 
rates for different types of  smokers, and shows how to estimate bias based  on observed rather 
than  true  underlying data. Weaknesses in  the  methods  of  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection 
Agency (EPA)8 are demonstrated, and an alternative methodology described. Using this, and the 
complex  set  of  misclassification  rates  used  by  EPA,’  the  estimated  biases  are  shown  to  be 
virtually the same as those estimated using a single misclassification rate, of ever smokers as never 
smokers. After considering plausible values of  the between-spouse smoking concordance rate and 
of  the  ever-smoker/never-smoker misclassification  rate,  the simplified methodology  is  then, in 
Section 5, applied  to US. data.  In  Section 6 the  methodology  is  applied  to data from  Asian 
studies, accounting  for  possible  higher  misclassification  rates.  Section 7  discusses other issues 
affecting interpretation of  the ETS/lung cancer relationship, and in  Section 8 the main findings 
are reviewed and discussed.

2.1.  The simplest situation 

Consider  N  married  individuals  of  which  a  proportion  s smokes. Let  the  proportion  whose 
spouse smokes be rnl  for non-smokers and m 2  for smokers. Assume m 2  > ml. Let the lung cancer 
risk for a given period be y for non-smokers and Ry for smokers, and be independent of  spouse 
smoking. Assume  a  random  proportion  p  ( > 0) of  smokers are misclassified  as  non-smokers. 
Expected numbers of  subjects before (‘true data’) and after (‘observed  data’) misclassification are 
then:

2.2.  Effect of  misclassification on the concordance ratio 

The association of  husbands’ and wives’ smoking habits is often measured  by  the concordance 
ratio  k = ad/bc = m2(1 - ml)/ml(l  - m2). Since  m2 > m l ,   k  > 1.  The  observed  concordance 
ratio k*  = a*d*/b*c* satisfies the conditions  1 < k*  < k. 

2.3.  Effect of  misclassification on the active smoking risk 

The observed active smoking RR, obtained by dividing risks in groups 6 and 3 (ignoring spousal 
smoking) is  R*  = R(u + pu)/(u + pRu). It  satisfies  1 < R*  < R.  The  ratio  of  observed  to  true 
excess risks  (R* - l)/(R  - 1) equals  (1 - s)/(l  - s + pRs) and  declines as the misclassification 
rate, proportion  of  smokers and true risk increase. 

2.4.  Effect of  misclassification on the spousal smoking risk 

The observed spousal smoking RR, obtained by dividing risks in groups 2 and 1 (in non-smokers), 
is E*  = (a + pc)(b + pRd)/(b + pd)(a + pRc) and satisfies E*  > 1. Thus misclassification creates 
an  apparent  risk  from  spousal  smoking  when  no  true  effect  exists.  We  refer  to  this  as  the 
‘misclassification bias’. 

2.5.  Maximum misclassification bias and rate 

E*  can be expressed in terms of  the observed population  by: 

E*  = [(b* + d*(R - l)p/(l  - ~ ) ) u * ] / [ ( u *  + c*(R - l)p/(l  - p))b*]. 
E*  is a maximum when R is infinite. E*  then equals k*, so the bias cannot  exceed the observed 
infinite,  R*  = (u + pu)/pu = u*(l  - p)/u*p,  and  p  = 
concordance 
u*/(u* + R*o*), which is thus the maximum misclassification consistent with the observed active 
smoking data. 

ratio.  When  R 

is 

2.6.  Factors affecting the  magnitude of  the misclassification bias 
Defining Q  = c*(R - l)p/a*(l  - p), E*  = (1 + k*Q)/(l  + Q). E*  increases monotonically with k* 
and  Q.  Given  an  observed  distribution  of  smoking  habits  (a*, c*  and  k*)  E*  thus  increases 
strongly with the misclassification rate (being, for small p, approximately proportional  to p )  and 
with the active smoking RR (being proportional  to (R  - 1)). This formulation also suggests E* 
increases  with  the  concordance  ratio  and  with  the  proportion  of  smokers.  Defining 
z  = m2/m1 > 1, E* can be expressed as the cross-product  ratio of  four ratios of  observed to true 
data: 

Cases:  Spouse smoker 

Cases:  Spouse non-smoker 

Population:  Spouse smoker 

Population:  Spouse non-smoker 

hi  = (b + pRd)/b = 1 + pRsz/(l  - S)  = 1 + 6, 
h2 = 1 + pRs(1 - mlz)/(l  - s)(l - ml) = 1 + 8, 
h3  = 1 + psz/(l  - s) = 1 + 8 3  
h4 = 1 + ps(1 - mlz)/(l  - s)(l - ml) = 1 + 84 

For small p,  di are small, so E*  can be estimated approximately  by

The  bias  increases with  the  misclassification  rate,  the  smoking  excess risk,  the  proportion  of 
smokers and the concordance ratio (here parameterized  indirectly by  z)  and decreases with  the 
proportion of spouses who smoke. Table I shows how E*  actually (not approximately varies with 
these parameters. The same relationships apply. 

2.7.  Casekontrol rather than prospective study 

E*  can be calculated by  dividing an estimate ( h l / h 2 )  based on case data by  an estimate (h3/h4) 
based  on  population  data.  If  the  controls  are  representative  of  the  population,  and  if 
misclassification is independent of  case-control status, the above procedures can also be applied 
to  case-control  study  data.  Note  misclassification  of  cases  produces  upward  bias,  while 
misclassification  of  controls  produces  downward  bias.  For  small  p, 
the  upward 
the  downward  bias = h3/h4 N  1 + g,  where  g = ps(z - 1)/ 
bias = hl/hz /I: 1 + Rg  and 
(1 - s)(l - ml). 

2.8.  Risk of  disease associated with misclassification 

In  Section  2.1  misclassification  of  smoking  was  assumed  random,  with  the  same  risk  in 
misclassified and correctly classified smokers. This may well  be untrue in practice. Misclassified

smokers may  have smoked less and/or  longer  ago, suggesting a  lower  risk  than  smokers who 
report their smoking. On the other hand, misclassification may be common in subjects who have 
ignored doctor's advice to give up smoking following a visit relating to symptoms rendering them 
at higher than average risk. 
If correctly classified smokers have w times the risk of misclassified smokers, and R'  and R" are 
their risks, relative to true non-smokers, we can solve R' = wR" and (1 - p)R' + pR"  = R to give 
R  = R / ( p  + (1 - p)w) and  R'  = wR/(p + (1 - p)w). The  observed  active smoking  RR  is then 
given by  R*  = R'(u + pu)/(u + pR"u). R*  is usually  -=  R, but this need not be so, for example, if 
p  is small and  u is much larger than  u, R*  N R'  which is  > R  if  w > 1. 

The observed spousal smoking RR is given by the same formulae as in Sections 2.4-2.6  with 
R  replaced  by  R .  Assuming  the  risk  of  misclassified  smokers  exceeds  that  of  non-smokers, 
positive misclassification bias will  occur. 

2.9.  Misclassification associated with spousal smoking habits 

The  random  misclassification  assumption  also  means  that  rates  are  independent  of  spousal 
smoking. This may  also be  untrue, with  people married  to a non-smoker  less willing to admit 
smoking. 
If  the misclassification rate is p1 when the spouse smokes and p 2  when  the spouse does not, 
E'  = (a + p2c)(b + pIRd)/(b + p , d ) ( a  + p2Rc). It is clear p1 causes positive bias and p 2  negative 
bias. Given p l ,  E'  declines with increasing p 2 ,  the overall bias ceasing to be positive (E' = 1) if 
p2/p1 = k.  If  p 2  > k p , ,  negative bias will  occur. 

2.10.  Misclassification of non-smokers as smokers 
So  far  it  has  been  assumed  no  non-smokers  are  misclassified  as  smokers.  Now  if  q  is  the 
proportion  of  misclassified non-smokers, we  have:

The observed active smoking RR is given by 

R**  = ( 4 ~  + (1 - p)Ru)((l - 4 ) ~  + p V ) / ( q U  + (1 - p)u)((l  - q)u + PRO). 

If  p  + q < 1, R**  satisfies 1 < R**  < R*  < R. 

The observed spousal smoking RR is given by 

E**  = ((1 - 4)a + pC)((l - q)b + pRd)/((l - q)b + p d ) ( ( l  - q)a + ~ R c ) .

P. LEE AND B. FOREY 

Writing p**  = p/(l  - q) it is clear the formula for E** is identical to that in Section 2.4, with p** 
replacing p .  Thus, for example, a  5  per  cent  misclassification  rate  of  smokers as non-smokers 
causes the same bias as a  5.26 per cent rate in  both  directions. Misclassification of  smokers is 
clearly a much more important  cause of  bias than is the reverse misclassification, which has no 
effect  on its own  and only slightly reduces the spurious  RR estimate otherwise. Because of  this, 
and as false claiming of  smoking is probably  quite rare, most attempts to quantify the bias have 
ignored this reverse misclassification. 

2.1 1.  Misclassification of  spousal smoking 

So  far it has  been assumed  subjects but  not  spouses are misclassified. If  r  is the  proportion  of 
smoking spouses misclassified we  have:

The observed concordance ratio k***  = a***d***/b***c*** is a more severely biased estimate of 
k, satisfying 1 < k***  < k*  < k .  

Misclassification  of  spousal  smoking  does  not  affect  the  observed  active  smoking  risk,  so 

R***  = R* 

The observed spousal smoking RR is given by 

E***  = (a + pc + r ( b  + p d ) ) ( b  + pRd)/(a + pRc + r(b + p R d ) ) ( b  + p d ) .  
If  p  = 0,  E***  = 1, so  that  misclassification  of  spousal  smoking  causes  no  apparent  effect  of 
spousal smoking when  no  true  risk exists. Assuming p  > 0, E***  satisfies 1 < E*** < E*. For 
small p, (E*** - l)/(E* - 1) approximately equals  a*/(a*  + rb*). For small r  this is close to  1, 
implying that ignoring misclassification of  spousal smoking only leads to slight overestimation of 
the spousal smoking RR, which arises mainly from misclassification of  smoking by  the subject. 
The  above  calculations  assume  misclassification  of  subject  and  spousal  smoking  are 
independent. If  they are positively correlated, which might occur, if, say, both  were reported  by 
the same respondent, E would be reduced. If  all smokers who deny their smoking also deny their 
spouse’s, the observed spousal smoking RR will  be  < 1. 

2.12.  Summary 

The  results  above  show  that  misclassification  of  a  subject’s  smoking  habits  leads  to 
underestimation  of  the  strength  of  the  active  smoking/lung cancer  relationship  and  of  the 
concordance  between  husbands’ and  wives’ smoking habits,  consistent  with  the  general thesis 
that random misclassification leads to underestimation  of  the strength  of  positive associations. 
By contrast, providing there is positive concordance between spouses’ smoking habits, random 
misclassification of some subjects who smoke as non-smokers leads to an apparent relationship of 
spousal  smoking  to  risk  in  non-smokers  when  no  true  relationship  exists.  The  size  of  the

misclassification bias  depends on  the misclassification rate, the excess active smoking risk, the 
proportion  of  smokers, the concordance ratio,  and  the proportion  of  spouses who smoke. It is 
little affected by  misclassification of  non-smokers as smokers, or of  smoking by  spouses, which 
will  be  ignored  hereafter.  More  crucial  to  the  size  of  the  bias  are  the  possibilities  that 
misclassification rates may depend  on risk of  disease or on spousal smoking habits. If  smokers 
with a relatively low risk of lung cancer or who are married to non-smokers tend to be more likely 
to deny smoking, the bias will  be less than indicated  by  the formula in  Section 2.4.

model. Expected numbers  of  subjects after misclassification are then:

The changed assumptions, which only affect risks, do not change the effect of  misclassification 

on the concordance ratio (see Section 2.2). 

3.2.  Effect of misclassification on  the active smoking relative risk 

For  the multiplicative model, the observed active smoking RR  is given by 
RC  = R(c + Ed)(# + pv)/v((a + ~ R c )  + E ( b  + pRd)). 
This is biased even without misclassification (p = 0) due to failure to adjust for spousal smoking. 
When adjustment for spousal smoking is made, the active smoking RR will be biased downwards 
by misclassification. For example, within subjects with non-smoking spouses, the observed active 
smoking RR will  be given by  the expression R(a + pc)/(a + pRc), which is  < R. 

For the additive model, the observed active smoking RR  is given by 

RZ  = (Rc + ( E  + R  - l ) d ) ( ~  + P U ) / U ( ( ~  + ~ R c )  + Eb + p ( E  + R  - 1)d). 
The  ratio  of  risks  in  smokers to non-smokers,  among  those  married  to a smoker  is  equal  to 
(E + R  - l)/E. As this is  < R, the active smoking RR will be biased downwards even when there 
is no misclassification and when  adjustment  is made for spousal  smoking. 

3.3.  Effect  of misclassification on the spousal smoking relative risk 

For the multiplicative model, the observed spousal smoking RR is given by 

EC  = E(a + pc)(b + pRd)/(b + pd)(u + ~ R c )  = EE*.

P. LEE AND B. FOREY 

Thus any  circumstances causing a given  bias in  the  simple model described in  Section 2 will 
multiply a true risk associated with spousal smoking by  the same factor. 
For the additive model, the observed spousal smoking RR is given by 

E]: = (a + pc)(Eb + p ( E  + R  - l)d)/(b + @)(a + ~Rc). 
This satisfies E]: -= E t .  Given p ,  E]: increases with  increasing E, starting at the value E*  when 
E = 1. The increase in EZ  is less steep than that in E, so that EX  = E when E  = a*d/b*c, which is 
approximately equal to the concordance ratio k. For higher values of  E, E:  will underestimate E, 
though  this  is  unlikely  in  practice  since  estimates  of  concordance  ratio  usually  substantially 
exceed estimates of  spousal smoking relative risk. 

3.4.  Estimates of  Wald and of  the US National Research Council 

In 1986, Wald et al."  and the US National Research Council7 used an additive model to correct 
spousal smoking RR estimates for bias. The methodology used was similar to that described here. 
However, it was applied using observed data to estimate s,  rn, and R, ignoring the fact that these 
data would themselves be subject to misclassification. This resulted in understatement  of the bias. 
Thus,  Wald  et  al.,"  using  estimates  of  s  = 050,  p  = 0.07,  ml  = 0.59,  m2 = 0-81, R  = 2  and 
E = 1.3 calculated the observed spousal smoking RR should be  1.3454, that is, an upward bias by 
3.5 per cent. In fact, after accounting for misclassification, appropriate estimates of s, mi  and R are 
05376,05721 and 2.3079. The observed spousal smoking RR can  then be estimated as  1.3725, 
that is, an upward bias by  5.6 per cent, almost 60 per cent more than Wald  et  a!."  calculated.

4.1.  The WellsStewart method 

In  their  report,  the  EPA8 described  and  used  the  method  of  Wells  and  Stewart  to  correct 
individual  study  RR  estimates  for  smoking  misclassification. The  method  has  two  notable 
features. First, rather  than simply classify subjects as smokers or non-smokers, four groups are 
considered: regular; occasional; former smokers, and lifelong non-smokers. The association with 
spousal  smoking  (which  remains  classified  in  two  groups)  is  studied  in  observed  lifelong 
non-smokers,  which  contain  true  lifelong  non-smokers  together  with  misclassified  regular, 
occasional and former smokers, the misclassification rate varying by smoking group. Second, the 
method  is based  on observed data. While in Sections 2 and  3 above, emphasis is on describing 
how  observed  RRs  depend  on  the  misclassification  rate,  given  true  underlying  values  of 
parameters such as s,  ml, m2, k, E and R, the Wells-Stewart  method  aims at estimating the true 
value of E, given assumed misclassification rates, and observed values of the parameters, including 
the spousal smoking RR. 

Elsewhere, Lee'3  discusses the  Wells-Stewart  method  in  detail.  He  points  out  the  method 
depends  on  many  inadequately  explained  and  justified  assumptions  and  imprecisely  known 
parameters, and refers to errors in the method. Thus: (i) it was assumed, totally implausibly, that 
the spousal smoking  RR multiplies the former smoking RR, but  not  the current  smoking RR; 
(ii) the multiplicative model was  applied to observed  RRs when  logically it would  only  apply 
(were it appropriate) to true RRs, that is, RRs before misclassification; (iii) the estimated RR for 
current  (versus never) smoking was  applied  to current  regular  smoking, but  current  smokers 
include  both  regular  and  occasional  smokers; (iv) in  estimating  the  observed  smoking  habit 
distribution of  the cases, the frequency of all former smokers (long-term and short term) has been 
multiplied by  a  risk  factor  derived for  long-term  smokers  only;  and  (v) the actual  method  of 

 10970258, 1996, 6, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0258(19960330)15:6<581::AID-SIM182>3.0.CO;2-B by Northeastern University, Wiley Online Library on [24/11/2024].

estimating corrected  numbers  of  never  smokers, given  the  observed  distribution  of  cases and 
controls  by  self  and  spouse's  smoking  habits  and  the  assumed  misclassification  rates,  is 
mathematically erroneous. 

In the following we describe an alternative procedure which is simpler, exact and involves fewer 
assumptions. As with the EPA method, it estimates E based on observed data, and allows various 
categories  of  smokers  to  be  misclassified  (though  it  can  also  be  applied  to  the  simple 
smoker/non-smoker  case). 

4.2.  Adjusting the spousal smoking relative risk  using observed data - assumptions and notation 
Let  subjects  who  smoke  be  categorized  into  n  increasing  levels  ( i  = 1, ... ,n). The  notation 
previously used is extended by  a subscript for smoking level. The true distribution of smoking in 
controls is then: 

Spouse 

Subject 

Never  Level  1 

...  Level  i 

...  Level  n 

Non-smoker 
Smoker 
Total 

a 
b 
U 

C 1  

d i  

' J l  

Ci 
di 
ui 

Cn 
d n  
'Jn 

with asterisks used  for the observed distribution. 
For a multiplicative model, the true RRs are: 

Spouse 

Subject 

Never  Level  1 

...  Level  i 

...  Level  n 

~ 

Non-smoker 
Smoker 

1 
E 

R1 
R l E  

Ri 
RiE 

R. 
RnE 

The true distribution for cases (ignoring scaling factors) is given by  multiplying corresponding 
elements in  the  two  tables. Upper  case letters  indicate  the  result, for example, Di = diRiE for 
a multiplicative model. For an additive model, RiE is replaced by  Ri + E - 1. 

Let p i j  be the probability a smoker at level i  is misclassified at a lower level j. The relationship 
between true and observed distributions (for controls or cases, for spouse non-smoker or smoker) 
can be written down easily, for example, with n  = 2 and considering cases married  to a smoker: 

B * =   B +  
0: = 
D t  = 

PlODl  + 
(1 - Pl0)Dl + 

P 2 0 D 2  

P 2 1 D 2  
(1 - P 2 0   - P 2 l ) D Z .  

These formulae can be inverted to estimate true from observed data. 

Following the EPA, it is assumed there is no misclassification of  never smokers as smokers or 
of  spousal smoking and that misclassification of smoking by the subject is independent of spousal 
smoking and of  disease status.

4.3.  The estimation procedure - Step 1: obtaining observed and true smoking habit distributions for 
controls 

The case-control study for which the RR is to be adjusted provides estimates of observed number 
of  never smokers by  spousal smoking, a*  and b*, which can be  summed to give u*. 

Data on the total number of  subjects who smoke, t*  = X u ) ,  can be obtained directly in some 
studies,  or  indirectly  from  an  estimate  of  smoking  frequency  in  the  population,  s*,  by 
t*  = s*u*/( 1 - s*).  t* can then be multiplied by estimates of  the relative frequency of  smoking in 
the n  categories to give 0). 
d f  can then be estimated by  solving c f  + d )  = u)  and kf  = a*d)/b*cf. 

Given af,  bf and u),  and estimates of  the concordance ratio for each smoking level, kf , cf  and 

This gives the whole of the table for observed controls from which, as described in Section 4.2, 

the table for true controls can then be  estimated. 

4.4.  The estimation procedure - Step 2  obtaining smoking habit distributions for cases regardless of 
spouse smoking 

The study for which the RR is  to be  adjusted  provides estimates of  observed numbers of  never 
smokers by spousal smoking, A* and B*, which can be summed to give U*. Given estimates of the 
observed smoking RR in  the various  categories, R),  estimates  of  V:  can  then  be  obtained  by 
Rf  = V:u*/v:U*. 

Alternatively, if the total number of  smokers in the cases, T * = XV?, is known and estimates of 
the  excess risks  of  smoking in  the  various  categories, X ) ,  relative to category  n(X,* = l), are 
available, estimates of  V:  can  be  obtained  from  2n  equations:  R)  = Vyu*/ufU*  (i = 1, ... ,n), 
R )  = 1 + X?(R,* - 1) (i = 1,. . . , n  - l), and  T *  = Z V:. 

The relationships of  Section 4.2 are then used to give U and  V i ,  the total number of true cases 

subdivided by  subject’s smoking. 

4.5.  The estimation procedure - Step 3: estimating the true spousal smoking relative risk 
Assume  a  starting  value  of  E = k, perhaps  the  observed  value  of  the  spousal  smoking  RR 
i = B*a*/A*b*  or  a  value  somewhat  less.  Solve  ,!?  = Ba/Ab  and  U  = A  + B 
to  give 
A  = aU/(a + b k )  and B = U  - A .  
For  the  multiplicative  model  Ri = Cia/Aci, Ri = Dib/Bdi and  Ci + D i  = V i .  Solving  gives 
Ci = AbciVi/(Badi + Abc,) and hence D i  and  R i .  
For  the  additive  model, the  second  equation  is  replaced  by  (Ri + ,!?  - l ) / i  = Dib/Bdi, and 

solving gives 

C i  = Aci(bVik - Bdi(k - l))/(Badi + Abcik) 

and hence D i  and R , .  

The whole table for true cases has now been obtained, and using the relationships in Section 
4.2, the complete table for observed cases can then be estimated. If  the estimate of  B*  exceeds the 
actual study value assume a lower value of  k; if  it  is less try  a higher value. 

The whole procedure is then repeated iteratively until the estimate of  B*  equals that observed. 

This gives the value of  E  adjusted for smoking habit  misclassification. 

The relationships of  Section 4.2 then allow completion of  the table of  observed case data and 
can be estimated in the normal 

hence of  observed RRs. 95 per cent confidence limits of  E  and 
way from the true and observed 2 x 2 tables (a, b, A,  B  and  a*, b*, A*,  B*).

4.6.  Example 

As in the EPA report,'  data from Correa et a l l 4  study are used to illustrate the method. The data 
observed are as follows:

A * =  
B*  =  14

Associated with these data are estimates of  52.8 per cent for the observed proportion of  subjects 
who had never smoked and of 2.066 and 12.396 for the observed spousal and active smoking RRs. 

Following to a considerable extent the  EPA  report,'  we  assume:

Three levels of  smoking by  the subject: former ( i  = l), occasional ( i  = 2), and regular ( i  = 3). 
Former  smokers are 35.5 per cent  of  ever smokers (u:  = 0.355t*). 
90 per cent of  current  smokers are regular smokers (u:  = 0.9 (u:  + u:)). 
The concordance  ratio for ever/never smokers is 2.8 (a*Xd* = 2*8b*Zc*). 
The concordance  ratio for former/never smokers is 2-2 (k: = 2.2). 
The  concordance  ratios  for  occasional/never  and  regularfnever  smokers  are  the  same 
(k:  = k;). 
The observed excess risks for former and occasional smokers are, respectively, 9 per cent and 
20  per cent of  those for regular smokers. 
There is a multiplicative model between the true risks. 
The true to observed misclassification probabilities  (pij) are

Assumption 8  is  the main  difference from the  EPA assumptions.  Their multiplicative model 

applied to observed rather than true smokers, and did not  apply  to current  smokers. 

Following Section 4.3 (with minor adaptation as the concordance ratios are not given level by 
level) the data, together with assumptions  1 to 6, lead to the following table of  observed control 
data:

The misclassification corrected spousal smoking RR is thus 1.708, so that misclassification has 
caused upward  bias by  a factor  2.066/1.708 = 1.209. An  additive model  would lead, as shown 
below, to a corrected RR of  1-900, a bias of  1.087. The latter is closer to the EPA bias estimate of 
1.10 (corrected  RR = 1.89), presumably  as the  RRs  in  the  current  smoking  groups  are  less 
dependent on spousal smoking, so being more consistent with their assumptions.

4.7.  Simplification of  the  model 

In  the  example  above,  the  upward  bias  depends  on  assumed  values  of  six  misclassification 
probabilities. To simplify further  work, the  relationship of  the  bias to  these probabilities was 
investigated further. 

First, it was clear the values of the misclassification probabilities from regular or occasional to 
former smokers had  little effect on the  bias. Setting these to zero changed the  bias only from 
1.2093 to  1.2167 (multiplicative model) or from  1.0873 to  1.0871 (additive). 

Second, it  was also clear misclassification of  regular smokers as never smokers contributed 
most to the bias. With other misclassification rates set to zero and using a multiplicative model, 
the biases resulting from misclassification of  regular, occasional or former smokers only were, 
respectively, 1-1021,14416 and 1.0427. These represent excess biases that are, respectively, 47, 19 
and  20  per  cent  compared  with  the  bias,  1.2167, associated  with  all  three  misclassification 
probabilities combined. These excess biases are in the  ratio  1 : 0-407 : 0.418, quite close to that 
predicted 1 : 0.368 : 0.378 by assuming bias is proportional to the product of misclassification rate, 
observed  excess  risk,  observed  concordance  ratio  and  observed  frequency  of  the  smoking 
category in the controls, an approximate formula suggested by  Section 2. For the additive model, 
the biases resulting from misclassification of regular, occasional and former smokers only were, 
respectively, 1.0480, 1-0190 and 14040. These represent excess biases that are respectively 55,22 
and  5 per cent compared with  the combined bias of  1-0871. 

Thirdly, for both multiplicative and additive models the bias from the full analysis described in 
Section 4.6 was quite close to that arising from a simpler model with only one smoking level, in 
which  1-75 per cent of  ever smokers were misclassified as never smokers, with the concordance 
ratio  set  as  3-0. Thus,  for  a  multiplicative model,  this  simpler model  gave a  bias  of  1.1850 
compared with  1.2093 for the full model. For the additive model, the simpler model gave 1-0806 
and the full model  1.0873. 

These general conclusions were confirmed using data from other studies. Table I1 summarizes 
results for the Correa study14 and for four other large U.S. 
These show misclassifi- 
cation to former smokers is unimportant, misclassification of  regular smokers as never smokers 
accounts for about  half  of  the total  bias and that  the assumptions used  are similar in effect to 
using the simpler model with a misclassification rate of  1.75 per cent and a concordance ratio of 
3.0. The biases for the multiplicative and additive models are similar where the observed spousal

RR is near unity (Brownson, Fontham, Garfinkel). For larger spousal risks (Stockwell, Correa) 
the bias from the multiplicative model is larger. 

5.  APPLICATION OF THE METHODOLOGY T O  DATA  FOR U.S. FEMALES 

5.1.  Introduction 

The simplified methodology of Section 4 is now applied to available data for U.S. females. Studies 
conducted  in  the U.S. and in  Asia (considered in  Section  6) are the  main  contributors to the 
evidence,  and  data  for  females  are much  more  extensive  than  for  males.  The  US. data  are 
described in Section 5.2, followed by discussion, in Sections 5.3 and 5.4, of appropriate ranges of 
concordance ratios and misclassification rates to use. The methodology is applied in Section 5.5, 
and the results  compared with  those  of  others in Section 5.6. 

5.2.  U.S. epidemiological data on lung cancer and spousal smoking in females 

Table  I11  summarizes  relevant  data  from  13 U.S.  ~ t u d i e s . ’ ~ - ’ ~  
(Data from  one  studyz7 are 
ignored, being based  on only nine lung cancer cases, and only  one in ever smokers whose risk, 
unusually, was less than in never smokers.) Points to note  about the  studies are: 

(i)  Only  one  study2’ was  prospective.  For this  study,  ‘number  of  controls’ are number of 

subjects at the start of  the study. 

(ii)  Most studies concerned all histological  types of lung cancer but three14* 

z 6  considered 

specific types only. 

(iii) The index  of  exposure  varied. Ten  studies concerned  spousal  smoking but  varied  as to 
whether  smoking of  products  other  than cigarettes  was considered, and when  smoking 
2 5   concerned  at home  exposure,  not  specifically from the 
occurred.  Three  studies’g* ”* 
spouse. For one study”  the index  related  only to heavier exposure.

P. LEE AND B. FOREY 

(iv) The crude spousal RR  corresponds to the  2 x 2  table  of  unexposed  and  exposed  never 
smoking controls and cases. For the prospective study,z1 the RR and numbers of controls 
are in fact age standardized, crude data not  being presented. 

(v)  Adjusted spousal RRs are as reported, with the potential confounding variables considered 

varying by  study. 

(vi)  Some  s t ~ d i e s ~ ~ * ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ * ~ ~ * ~ ~  

gave  direct  data  on  numbers  of  ever  smoking  cases  and 
controls, from which estimates of proportions of ever smokers and of active smoking RRs 
could be  calculated directly. For  other studies, estimates were  either  taken  from  other 
publications or, shown in  square brackets, calculated from other  studies conducted  at 
a similar time. 

The data in Table 111 are as used by EPA’  except: (a) three additional studies15* 

’’ have been 
included; (b) the  Fontham  et  at. study  data  are  updated  from  a  recent  report;I6 (c)  for  the 
Garfinkel case-control study”  data  were  used  for  ‘spouse ever  smoked‘ rather  than  ‘spouse 
smoked at home’, the former index being more  consistent with  that  used  in  other studies; (d) 
numbers for the Janerich et al. 
given for the sexes combined by EPA, have been estimated 
separately for females;”  and (e) ever smoking RRs have  been  used  for  the  Wu  et  al. studyz6 
whereas EPA gave current smoking risks. 

Ignoring misclassification, the data show some evidence of  a positive association for spousal 
smoking. Fixed-effects meta-analysis”  gives an RR estimate of  1-13 (95 per cent CI  1.01-1.27)  for 
the  unadjusted  data  and  1.13  (95  per  cent  CI  1.01-1.26)  for  the  covariate-adjusted  data.  As 
adjustment for covariates had little effect, as the misclassification adjustment procedures are not 
designed to  deal  with  data  subdivided by  covariates, and  as the  source papers  rarely  if  ever 
present such subdivided data anyway, misclassification adjustment will (in Sections 5.5 and 6) be 
applied to the data unadjusted for covariates. 

5.3.  Concordance ratios 

EPA’  assumed that, for the 2 x 2 table subject: never/ever smoker; spouse: never/ever smoker, the 
concordance (cross-product) ratio is 2.8, and  that, for the 2 x 2 table subject; never/ex-smoker; 
spouse: neverfever smoker, is 22. A value of  3.2 for the concordance ratio subject: never/current 
smoker; spouse: never/ever smoker, was also provided, but not used in the adjustment procedure, 
as this would lead to over definition. 

As support for these estimates, EPA cited four 

but gave no detailed data. In 
fact, the first referen~e’~ gives no relevant data at all, the second3’  only gives data relevant to 
a different concordance ratio, while the third3’ only gives data relevant to the first of  the three 
concordance  ratios  (giving  a  value  of  1.74  for  women  and  2.49  for  men).  Only  the  fourth 
reference3’  gives  a  joint  breakdown  of  smoking  habits  of  subjects  and  spouses  by 
never/ex/current status and even that was estimated indirectly, and suggests concordance ratios 
of  2.4,  1-9 and 2.8 rather than 2.8, 2.2 and 3.2. 

EPA also assumed that for current smokers the association with spousal smoking was the same 
for occasional and regular smokers. In fact, the only study cited3’ actually showed that the more 
the subject smoked the more likely the subject was to be married to a smoker. 

The concordance ratio estimates of  EPA are not solidly based. Elsewhere”  Lee summarizes 
data  from  17  studies.  Four  provide  estimates  of  the  subject:  never/ever  smoker;  Spouse: 
never/ever smoker concordance ratio. For females the estimates were 1.74,2.67,2.19 and 2.65. For 
males, the estimates (whose expected values are the same due to symmetry) were 2.49, 1.95, 2-32 
and  3-10. The mean  of  these  values  is  239.  The  remaining studies provided  16 independent 
estimates  of  the  subject:  non-current/current  smoker;  spouse:  non-current/current  smoker

concordance ratio which ranged from 2.56 to 6.04, with a mean of 3.98. Based on the 3 x 3 table of 
Lee,32 the  non-current/current  concordance ratio  should  be  about  1.36 times higher  than  the 
never/ever concordance ratio. If so, the mean of 3.98 for the former ratio implies a value of 2.93 for the 
latter ratio, rather higher than the mean of 2.39 for the four studies providing direct data. This look at 
the data suggests an appropriate value of the never/ever concordance ratio is almost definitely in the 
range 2 to 4, probably below 3 and probably nearer 3 than 2. However, we should bear in mind 
there is  highly  significant variation  between  estimates for different studies. Concordance  may 
depend,  among  other  things,  on  national  characteristics, the  exact  questions  asked  and  the 
circumstances of interview. Limited evidence’  suggests no clear relationship with age, however. 

5.4.  Misclassification rates 

Evidence on the extent of  misclassification has been discussed by  Lee”.  12, 33  and Wells.’.  3 4 9   3 5  
There are two main sources of  data, studies in which biochemical markers of  smoke uptake are 
used  to validate statements about current  smoking, and  studies in which  statements made on 
different occasions about  smoking are  checked for  consistency. It  is  useful  to summarize the 
evidence from these studies, so highlighting difficulties in obtaining reliable rate estimates for use 
in adjustment procedures. 

As increases in carbon monoxide and thiocyanate commonly occur from sources other than 
smoking,  both  Lee  and  Wells  have  restricted  attention  to  studies  using  cotinine,  a  major 
metabolite of  nicotine, as a  biochemical marker  of  uptake.  Although  there are  some  dietary 
sources of nicotine, these cannot produce cotinine levels typical even of a light smoker.36 Cotinine 
levels of  current smokers are about two orders of  magnitude higher than those of  ETS exposed 
non-smokers. Although there may be slight overlap between levels in very light smokers and very 
heavily ETS-exposed non-smokers, it seems generally accepted that a cut-off of  10 per cent of the 
level of average smokers can be used to distinguish true smokers. A  30  per cent cut-off is often 
used  to  distinguish  regular  smokers. Reviewing  evidence from  cotinine  studies, virtually  all 
conducted in the U.S., U.K. or other Western populations, some points emerge. 

First, misclassified smokers (that is, self-reported non-smokers above the cut-off) have lower 
cotinine levels than  self-reported smokers; occasional smokers more often deny smoking than 
regular smokers (but see Section 6). 

Second, with similar cut-offs there is wide variation in the proportion of non-smokers found to 
be  smokers. Studies in  which  smokers are advised to give up smoking often report  very  high 
proportions of  15-40  per cent. Even ignoring such studies, as Lee and Wells have done, there is 
still marked  heterogeneity, proportions  ranging  from  under  1  per  cent  to  over  6  per  cent.” 
Clearly, study circumstances affect  misclassification rates, and, as  the  cotinine  and  ETS/lung 
cancer studies may  not  be comparable, there is uncertainty in extrapolating results from one 
study type to another. Wells’  suggests misclassification rates from ‘general population  studies’ 
may  be  much  higher  than  those  from  ‘epidemiological studies’, but  this  runs  counter  to  the 
conclusions of  Velicer et d3’ that the less the likelihood of  intervention the greater the accuracy 
of  self-report. In any case the distinction between such study types is unclear. 

Many cotinine studies only record current smoking habits, and some studies only report data 
for  self-reported  non-smokers.  Misclassification  adjustment  requires  knowledge,  not  of  the 
proportion  of  non-smokers  found  to  be  current  smokers, but  of  the  proportion  of  current 
smokers reporting they are Ivefelong  non-smokers. Wells’  estimates 1-07 per cent of  true regular 
smokers  and  17.7  per  cent  of  true  occasional  smokers  are  misclassified  as  never  smokers. 
Elsewhere33 Lee presents data from more studies showing, in total, 68  per cent higher rates of 
misclassification of  current smoking.

P. LEE  AND B. FOREY 

Various studies have compared smoking as reported by subjects on two occasions, some years 
apart. In a large study in Scotland, for example, cited by Lee,”  10.1 per cent of  ex-smokers and 
2.5  per  cent  of  current  smokers at initial  interview later  claimed never to have  smoked. Such 
studies may underestimate misclassification, as smokers may deny smoking on both  occasions. 
Data from six other studies were summarized by Wells,’  from which similar estimates of  11.7 per 
cent for ex-smokers and 3-9 per cent for current smokers were calculated. The individual study 
estimates varied considerably, however, for ex-smokers ranging from 0.0 per cent to 26.8 per cent. 
Compared  with  subjects  who  consistently  report  being  ex-smokers,  subjects  reporting  past 
smoking on only one occasion tend to report having given up longer ago and to have smoked less 
when they were ~moking.~’ Because of this, Wells, in the EPA report,’  assumed that inconsistent 
ex-smokers could be assigned the excess risk of  long-term ex-smokes, estimated as 9 per cent of 
that  of  current  smokers.  As  some  recent  ex-smokers  deny  smoking  this  estimate  may  be 
somewhat too low. 

The misclassification estimates of  Wells’  are similar in effect to assuming about 1-75 per cent of 
average ever smokers are misclassified as never smokers. Based on higher misclassification rates 
found in a more extensive data review, Lee33 estimated 2.5 per cent would be more appropriate. 
Taking into  account  other points  (multiple report  studies may  miss subjects denying on each 
occasion; some recent ex-smokers may  deny smoking), the figure would be slightly higher than 
this. However, there are considerable uncertainties. An appropriate figure is probably in the range 
2-3  per cent but  could, not implausibly, be anywhere in the range  1-4  per cent. 

Strictly, bias  calculations  should  allow for  a  smoker  being more  ready  to deny  his  habit  if 
married  to a non-smoker. The limited data on this”  do not suggest this is a major  issue. Full 
investigation would require a study with cotinine measured for both  husband  and  wife. 

There  is  no  evidence  whether,  given  actual  smoking  habits,  subjects  who  deny  smoking 
are  more  or  less  at  risk  of  lung  cancer  than  those  who  admit  it.  In  a  Danish  prospective 
study (Gyntelberg, personal communication), five  deaths occurred  from ischaemic  heart  disease 
among  men  who  had  reported  not  smoking  but  with  cotinine  levels  consistent  with  current 
smoking.  This  compared  with  0.8  expected  for  men  of  similar  age  reporting  smoking 
(p < 0.001). 

5.5.  Effect  of  misclassification adjustment on spousal risk  estimates 

Table  IV  presents  meta-analysis  RRs  for  the  U.S.  data  assuming:  (i)  various  levels  of 
misclassification; (ii) various concordance ratios; and (iii) either  a  multiplicative or an additive 
model.  The  combined  RR risk  estimate  decreases with  increasing  misclassification, and  (for 
a  non-zero  misclassification)  with  increasing  concordance.  For  low  misclassification  rates, 
estimates  from  the  multiplicative  and  additive  models  are  very  similar,  but  for  higher 
misclassification  rates,  the  additive  model  gives  slightly  lower  RR  estimates.  Even  with  an 
estimated misclassification rate as low as 0.5 per cent, the RR estimate becomes non-significant. 
For a rate of  1-75 per cent and a concordance ratio of  3.0, shown above to give results comparable 
to EPA’s more complex assumptions, the unadjusted  RR of  1.13 reduces to 1.05. Assuming a 2.5 
per cent misclassification rate, as noted  to be  reasonable, the association essentially disappears, 
with  RR  1.01 (95 per  cent  CI  0.9C1.14) for  a  concordance of  3.0. While there  is  uncertainty 
about the true misclassification rate and concordance ratio, these  analyses are consistent with 
the slight excess lung cancer risk observed in relation to smoking by  the husband, being due not 
to  ETS  exposure,  but  to  an  artefact  arising  from  misclassification  of  some  smokers  as 
non-smokers.

5.6.  Difference from conclusions reached by others 

In 1986 the NRC'  summarized data from 13 studies, five in the U.S.A.  They estimated an overall 
adjusted  RR  of  1-34 (95 per  cent  CI  1-18-153). After misclassification adjustment  the RR  was 
estimated to be about 1.25, and at least 1.15. Although (see Section 3.4) the methodology used was 
incorrect, the conclusions were similar to those derived from Table IV. Thus the NRC suggested 
a bias of  1.34/1.25 = 1.07 and at most 1.34/1.15 = 1.17. Applied to the unadjusted US. estimate of 
1.13 for the updated  data, these biases would  give adjusted figures of  1.06 and 0.97. The NRC 
conclusion that misclassification bias could not explain the association was not due to inadequate 
adjustment but to the much higher RR they started with. In this context, it is notable that there 
has  been  a  striking  tendency for more  recent studies to report  lower RRs.  Thus, while  the  22 
worldwide studies reporting findings up to 1988 provided a covariate-adjusted meta-analysis RR 
estimate of  1.35 (95 per  cent  CI  1.2g1.52) for  spousal  smoking, the  15 studies reported  later 
provide a RR  estimate of  only  1.01 (95 per cent  CI 091-1.11). 

The analysis of  Wald et a/."  also conducted  in  1986, was similar to that of  the NRC,  being 
based on the same  13 studies. However, as they assumed an exceptionally low misclassification 
rate, a lower bias estimate of  only  1.35/1.30 = 1.04 was calculated. 

The recent EPA report'  considered data from 11 U.S. studies, with an RR estimate of  1.22 (95 
per  cent  CI  1.04-1.44)  reducing to  1.19 (95 per  cent CI  1.01-1.38)  after adjustment. Assuming 
a 1.75 per cent misclassification rate, and a concordance ratio of  3-0, our analysis reduces an RR 
of  1.13 (95 per cent CI 1.01-1.27)  to 1.05 (95 per cent CI 0-93-1.18). There are three main reasons 
why  our misclassification adjusted  RR is much lower than that of  EPA, and non-significant: (i) 
our analysis includes three studies not considered by  EPA,'5*'8v25 onei5 a large study. Overall

P. LEE AND B. FOREY 

the three studies show no association with spousal smoking (RR = 1.01; 95 per cent CI 0.82-1.23); 
(ii) the individual study data we used give slightly lower RRs (see Section 5.2). Thus our estimate 
for the same 11 studies EPA used is 1-20 (95 per cent CI 1.05-1.38)  rather than 1.22; (iii) the actual 
bias estimated by  EPA, of  1.03, is substantially  lower than  we  estimate, 1.08, using apparently 
similar assumptions. The most notable difference is for the largest study,I6 where we estimate 1.08 
and the EPA only 1.01. This study was unusual as urine samples were used to determine cotinine 
levels. As  no  self-reported lifelong non-smoking  women with  lung  cancer  were  found  to have 
cotinine levels consistent with regular smoking, the EPA assumed a misclassification rate of  zero 
for regular smoking for  this study. This assumption is wholly  unjustified. Urine  samples were 
taken in hospital  after diagnosis. Since many  smokers give up smoking at time of  diagnosis of 
lung cancer, it is unusual for smoking to be permitted in hospitals, and cotinine has a relatively 
short  half  life  of  about  a  day,  one  cannot  infer that  none  of  those  cases who  were  regularly 
smoking around  the time of  diagnosis reported  being lifelong never smokers. 

6.  EFFECT O F  MISCLASSIFICATION IN ASIAN FEMALES 

Of  37  studies of  ETS and lung cancer worldwide, 16 have  been conducted  in Japan, China  or 
Hong K ~ n g . ~ '  Based on 1918 lung cancer cases in females, an overall RR estimate, unadjusted for 
covariates or misclassification, is a marginally significant 1.16 (95 per cent CI 1.03-1.31).  For these 
data,  misclassification  adjustment  at  about  the  level  suggested  by  EPA8 (that  is,  using  an 
ever/never smoker  misclassification  rate  of  1.75 per  cent,  a  concordance ratio  of  3-0, and  an 
additive  model) has  very  little  effect, reducing  the  RR  only  by  001 to  1.15 (95 per  cent  CI 
1.02-1.30).  This trivial adjustment, as EPA8 also reported, is due to the few Asian  women who 
smoke and the lower RR  when they do. However, this assumes misclassification rates in Asian 
and  Western  populations  are  similar,  as  the  evidence  on  misclassification  comes  almost 
exclusively from Western populations. Great doubt has been cast on this assumption by a recent 
of 400 married Japanese women, in which as many as 20.8 per cent of current smokers (as 
determined by cotinine) reported being never smokers. The misclassified smokers had very similar 
cotinine  levels  to  smokers  who  admitted  smoking.  While  the  circumstances  of  interview 
(door-to-door interviews) and age range (2&55)  differed from the ETSJung-cancer  studies, the 
findings fit  in  with  a  long-held  suspicion that  misclassification  rates  may  be  much  higher  in 
Japanese  than  U.S.  women,  smoking  by  women  being  socially  unacceptable  in  Japan. 
A concordance ratio of  3.0 and a 20 per cent misclassification rate applied to the overall Asian 
data would totally eliminate the association (RR = 0.99,95 per cent CI = 0.87-1-12), while even 
a  10 per  cent  rate  would  render  it  non-significant (RR = 1.09, 95 per  cent  CI 0.97-1.23).  The 
Japanese  study  actually  suggested rather  a  higher  concordance than  seen  in  Western  studies, 
further emphasizing the importance of  bias due to misclassification. 

7.  OTHER  ISSUES AFFECTING INTERPRETATION  O F  DATA ON ETS 
AND LUNG CANCER 

7.1.  Other sources of  bias 

Misclassification of smoking is not the only source of bias relevant to the relationship of  spousal 
smoking to lung cancer. Others include: 

(i) Inaccuracy  of  exposure.  Misclassification  of  spousal  exposure  will  (see  Section  2.10) 
underestimate  any  true  risk.  Also,  as  some  non-smokers  married  to  non-smokers  are 
exposed to ETS, the RR for non-smokers married to smokers, as traditionally  calculated,

will underestimate their risk relative to a truly non-exposed population. Layard4’ reviews 
the difficulties in adjusting for background  risk. 

(ii) Inaccuracy of diagnosis.  Without autopsy, a false-positive clinical diagnosis of lung cancer 
is common.41 In many of the Asian and European studies a high proportion of cases were 
diagnosed without  histological confirmation. 

(iii) Recall  bias.  Almost all the ETS/lung cancer studies are case-control, in  which  recall of 

smoking, ETS, and other exposures may be affected by disease presence. 

(iv) Confounding.  For  many  lifestyle risk  factors  for  many  diseases, prevalence is  not  only 
increased  in  smokers, but  is  also  somewhat increased in  ETS-exposed never  smokers. 
A  recent  study4’  concluded  that  ‘confounding by  multiple  risk  factors  may  be  an 
important issue in passive smoking studies’. 

(v)  Publication  bias.  Spousal smoking RR estimates tend to be lower for studies with  large 
numbers of cases.12s43 Based on the latest data, this difference is significant ( p  = 0.01) with 
(covariate-adjusted) RRs of  1.07 (95 per cent CI 0.97-1.17),  1.35 (95 per cent CI 1.14-159) 
and  1.42 (95 per cent CI  1.07-1.90)  for studies with, respectively, more than  100, 50-100, 
and less than 50 cases. This is consistent with publication bias. A technique for carrying 
out a meta-analysis whilst adjusting for publication bias has been proposed.44 

(vi)  Study quality.  Elsewhere43 Lee defined a study as having a serious weakness if any of seven 
criteria were present. 16  studies can be  classified ‘inferior’ using these criteria including 
9 out of  10 of the studies with the highest RRs. The overall RR (adjusted for covariates) for 
the ‘inferior’ studies is 1.29 (95 per cent CI 1.15-1-45), significantly (p < 0.01) greater than 
that  for  the  21  ‘superior’ studies, which,  at  1.03  (95  per  cent  CI  0.93-1.14),  show  no 
significant association with spousal smoking. 

7.2.  Evidence from other indices of  ETS exposure 

Early  ETS/lung  cancer  studies  presented  data  only  for  husband’s  smoking,  and  published 
meta-analyses have tended to concentrate on this index. This includes the  EPA report,’  which 
considered these results at length but did not give even basic results for any other index, although 
considerable evidence has accumulated for workplace and childhood ETS exposure. Based on 15 
individual sex-specific RR  estimates from  12  studies, a  combined  RR  estimate  (adjusted  for 
covariates) for workplace exposure is 1.00 (95 per cent CI 0-91-1.08). Based on 15 estimates from 
14  studies, the  RR  estimate for  childhood  exposure  is  0.96  (95  per  cent  CI  0.87-1.06).  This 
compares with  1-14 (95  per  cent  CI  1*061.23), based  on  37  studies, for  husband‘s  smoking. 
Concentration  on  the index showing an  association, at the expense of  others which  do not, is 
a  major  form  of  publication  bias.  Two  alternative extreme views  of  the  conflict  between the 
spousal and the workplace/childhood results are possible. One is that spousal smoking is much 
more susceptible than the other indices to misclassification, and perhaps also confounding, bias 
as concordance is much stronger for spouses than for co-workers or for parents and their children. 
The other is that working with a smoker and having a parent smoke in childhood are both very 
poor markers of actual exposure, spousal smoking finding an association as it is the only adequate 
marker.  This  second  explanation  seems  weak.  Working  with  a  smoker  is  clearly  correlated 
with increased ETS exposure (though probably less so than is marriage to a smoker), and, if  ETS 
exposure really increased risk, an association with lung cancer incidence would be expected. 

7.3.  Dose-response  relationships 

Our  methodology compares  risk  in  non-smokers  according  to  whether  or  not  the  husband 
smoked,  regardless  of  how  much  he  smoked.  The  EPA  report’  stressed  the  existence  of 

 10970258, 1996, 6, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0258(19960330)15:6<581::AID-SIM182>3.0.CO;2-B by Northeastern University, Wiley Online Library on [24/11/2024].

P. LEE AND B. FOREY 

a dose-response  relationship, with RR estimates generally highest in the women whose husbands 
smoked the most. In interpreting this finding it should be noted that studies reporting relatively 
high  RRs for spousal smoking are much  more  likely to present  data by  amount  smoked  than 
those  that  do  not.  Thus,  for  the  19  studies  which  presented  dose-response  data,  the  overall 
spousal  smoking  RR  (adjusted  for  covariates)  was  1.36  (95  per  cent  CI  1.23-1-51),  highly 
significantly ( p  < 0.001) greater than the RR  of  093 (95 per cent CI 0.83-1.04)  for the 18 studies 
which  did  not.  This  form  of  publication  bias  means  RR  estimates  for  non-smoking  women 
married  to heavily  smoking husbands  are strongly  biased  upward.  It  may  also  be  that,  given 
a choice of  indices of  ETS exposure, an author may only present detailed findings for the index 
showing the  clearest  trend.  Other  biases  may  affect  the  dose-response  relationship.  Thus,  as 
concordance increases with amount smoked, smoking misclassification will also contribute to the 
observed dose response. 

7.4.  Histological type 

The association of lung cancer with active smoking is much greater for squamous carcinoma than 
for adenocarcinoma.  If  ETS is  seen, crudely, as a  smaller dose  of  active smoking, it  might  be 
expected, had it any effect at all, to be more strongly associated with risk of  squamous carcinoma. 
Findings for those ETS/lung cancer studies reporting  results separately by  histological type do 
not fit in with this expectation. While for some studies the results do seem more consistent with 
a relationship with squamous carcinoma, there are an equal number where the relationship seems 
more with adenocarcinoma, as well  as some studies with similar, or a lack of, relationship  with 
either.43 

7.5.  Plausibility 

Active smoking is strongly associated with risk of  lung cancer and ETS and mainstream  smoke 
contain many chemicals in common, albeit in different relative concentrations.8 It can be argued 
(especially by  adherents of  the ‘no-threshold’ hypothesis) that  an association of  ETS with  lung 
cancer is to be  expected. However, the amount  of  particulate matter (‘tar’)  retained  by  passive 
smokers is thousands of  times lower than that retained by active smokers. If, as many believe, ‘tar’ 
retention is relevant to lung carcinogenesis, and the dose-response  relationship is approximately 
linear, the observed spousal smoking RR (about  1.15-1-20) would be much higher than expected 
on  dosimetric  grounds  (about  1.01-1.02).  Based  on  this  argument,  most  of  the  observed 
association could be  due to bias. 

8.  DISCUSSION 

Misclassification of  smoking habits  leads to underestimation  of  the association  of  lung cancer 
with active smoking. Given positive concordance  between smoking habits of  spouses, however, 
random  misclassification of  some smokers as non-smokers  will  result in  overestimation  of  the 
association of  lung cancer with ETS in studies of  non-smokers where marriage to a smoker is the 
index of  exposure. Sections 2 and 3  show how  this bias depends on various factors. It tends to 
increase  with  an  increasing  misclassification  rate  of  smokers  as  non-smokers,  concordance, 
proportion  of  subjects who smoke, and proportion  of  spouses who  smoke. Misclassification of 
non-smoking subjects as smokers or of  smoking by  spouses has little effect on the bias, and the 
mathematics is simplified by ignoring these possibilities. Bias estimates can be materially affected 
if  misclassification  of  smoking is  not  random.  Section 4 accounts for  one  important  form  of 
non-randomness,  arising as current  regular  smokers are less likely to deny  smoking  than  are 

 10970258, 1996, 6, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0258(19960330)15:6<581::AID-SIM182>3.0.CO;2-B by Northeastern University, Wiley Online Library on [24/11/2024].

603 

occasional  or  long-term  ex-smokers.  However,  various  other  mechanisms  may  cause 
non-randomness. If, for example, smokers tend to be much more likely to deny smoking if  their 
spouse does not smoke, the bias will be reduced and may even be reversed. If, on the other hand, 
smokers who  are ill  and  at more  risk  of  developing lung cancer  are also  more  likely to deny 
smoking, the bias may be increased. Without hard data indicating the existence or importance of 
these forms of  non-randonness, we make no attempt to account for them. However, there is need 
for further research here, for example, a  study  where smoking by  husbands  and wives is both 
assessed and separately validated  using cotinine assays. 

Section 4  considers  the  possibility that  misclassification may  vary  by  type  of  smoker, and 
improves  the  correction  method  used  by  EPA,  which  has  numerous  errors.  Given  known 
misclassification rates and concordance ratios, and various other assumptions, the methodology 
allows estimation of  true numbers of  cases and controls in the various smoking categories from 
the observed data, and hence of  the misclassification-adjusted RR  associated with  marriage to 
a  smoker.  RR  estimates  for  individual  studies  can  then  be  meta-analysed.  This  method  is 
problematic due to the large number of misclassification rates and concordance ratios assumed, 
with data sparse or non-existent for many of  them. Luckily matters are simplified by noting (see 
Section 4.7) that for many studies the bias implied by the assumed values of the misclassification 
rates and concordance ratios is virtually identical to that implied by  a simpler model with only 
two  smoking  categories  (never,  ever),  a  single  misclassification  rate  of  1.75  and  a  single 
concordance ratio of  3.0. 

In Section 5 this simpler model is applied to data for U.S. females. With the misclassification 
rate of  1.75 and concordance ratio of 3.0, a marginally significant unadjusted meta-analysis RR of 
1.13 drops to a non-significant  1.05. In fact the misclassification rate could well be higher than 
1.75 per cent, further reducing the RR estimate. Though there is some doubt as to the appropriate 
rate, misclassification can certainly explain most of  the observed association of  spousal smoking 
with  lung cancer. 

As  fewer Asian  women  smoke, and  have  lower active smoking  RRs  when  they  do, a  given 
misclassification rate will cause far less bias in Asian than U.S. studies. However, evidence (which 
needs  replicating) from  Japan  suggests misclassification  rates  may  be  much  higher  in  Asian 
women.  If  so,  misclassification  may  cause  marked  bias  there.  Until  results  of  the  IARC 
multicentre study are published, European data are rather  sparse and are not considered here. 
Misclassification is only one reason to be wary of  accepting the association of lung cancer risk 
with spousal smoking as indicative of  a true effect of  ETS. As  discussed in  Section 7,  there are 
other sources of  bias (such as confounding). There is also evidence of  a lack of  association  with 
workplace  or  childhood  ETS  exposure. The  very  low  particulate  matter  retention  of  passive 
smokers also suggests the association with spousal smoking may  be  mainly an artefact. 

Our paper emphasizes the difficulties of  interpreting weak associations in epidemiology, and 
the need to quantify the various sources of  bias before coming to a firm conclusion. Though there 
are difficulties in  quantifying the exact effects of  smoking habit  misclassification, our analyses 
show its likely importance and cast doubt on simple interpretation  of  the association  between 
lung cancer and spousal smoking as indicative of  a cause and effect relationship.
