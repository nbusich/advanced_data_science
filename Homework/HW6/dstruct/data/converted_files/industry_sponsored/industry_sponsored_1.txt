introduction: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are designed to generate inhalable nicotine aerosol (vapor). When an e-ciga-
rette user takes a puff, the nicotine solution is heated and the vapor is taken into lungs. Although no sidestream vapor is generated 
between puffs, some of the mainstream vapor is exhaled by e-cigarette user. The aim of this study was to evaluate the secondhand 
exposure to nicotine and other tobacco-related toxicants from e-cigarettes.

Materials and Methods: We measured selected airborne markers of secondhand exposure: nicotine, aerosol particles (PM2.5), 
carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in an exposure chamber. We generated e-cigarette vapor from 3 vari-
ous brands of e-cigarette using a smoking machine and controlled exposure conditions. We also compared secondhand exposure 
with e-cigarette vapor and tobacco smoke generated by 5 dual users.

results: The study showed that e-cigarettes are a source of secondhand exposure to nicotine but not to combustion toxicants. 
The air concentrations of nicotine emitted by various brands of e-cigarettes ranged from 0.82 to 6.23 µg/m3. The average con-
centration of nicotine resulting from smoking tobacco cigarettes was 10 times higher than from e-cigarettes (31.60 ± 6.91 vs. 
3.32 ± 2.49 µg/m3, respectively; p = .0081).

Conclusions:  Using  an  e-cigarette  in  indoor  environments  may  involuntarily  expose  nonusers  to  nicotine  but  not  to  toxic 
tobacco-specific combustion products. More research is needed to evaluate health consequences of secondhand exposure to nico-
tine, especially among vulnerable populations, including children, pregnant women, and people with cardiovascular conditions.

intrOduCtiOn

Passive  smoking,  also  referred  to  as  exposure  to  secondhand 
smoke  (SHS),  happens  when  a  person  inhales  a  mixture  of 
toxic compounds released from burning cigarettes (California 
Environmental  Protection  Agency,  2005;  Nelson,  2001; 
Wallace-Bell,  2003).  Despite  the  comprehensive  smoke-free 
regulations  introduced  in  many  countries,  passive  smoking 
remains a global health problem. It has been estimated that pas-
sive  smoking  causes  more  than  six  hundred  thousand  deaths 
every  year  around  the  world  (Oberg,  Jaakkola,  Woodward, 
Peruga,  &  Prüss-Ustün,  2011).  Current  laws  and  regulations 
do  not  adequately  protect  vulnerable  populations,  including 
children,  pregnant  women,  and  those  with  preexisting  health 
conditions,  from  exposure  to  SHS.  Based  on  data  from  192 
countries, Oberg et al. (2011) estimated that 40% of children 
had  been  exposed  globally  to  SHS.  SHS  (also  referred  to  as 

environmental tobacco smoke, ETS) is comprised primarily of 
sidestream smoke released from burning cigarettes during puff 
breaks and smoke exhaled by smokers after each puff. While 
SHS  may  contain  the  same  toxic  substances  as  mainstream 
smoke,  it  contains  higher  concentrations  of  many  toxic  and 
carcinogenic  compounds  than  mainstream  smoke.  Although 
toxicants  released  from  burning  cigarettes  are  diluted  in  the 
indoor  air,  passive  smokers  are  often  exposed  to  secondhand 
smoke for prolonged periods of time.

Electronic nicotine delivery systems (commonly referred as 
electronic  cigarettes  or  e-cigarettes)  are  new  consumer  prod-
ucts  designed  to  generate  nicotine  aerosol  (vapor)  without 
combustion  of  tobacco. A  typical  e-cigarette  is  composed  of 
three essential parts: the battery, the heating element or atom-
izer, and a cartridge or tank that holds a nicotine solution. The 
product contains nicotine dissolved in propylene glycol, glyc-
erin, or the mixture of the two. When an e-cigarette user takes

a  puff,  the  nicotine  solution  is  heated  and  the  vapor  can  be 
inhaled into lungs. E-cigarettes are designed to deliver nicotine 
without  toxic  constituents  of  tobacco  or  tobacco  combustion 
toxicants and carcinogens. Studies have shown that vapor gen-
erated from e-cigarettes contains nicotine and that the devices 
might  be  effective  in  delivering  nicotine  to  the  body.  There 
is also some evidence that the vapor may contain some toxic 
compounds like carbonyls, traces of nitrosamines, or particles 
of  heavy  metals  (Bullen  et  al.,  2010;  Dawkins  &  Corcoran, 
2013; Etter & Bullen, 2011; Goniewicz, Knysak, et al., 2013; 
Goniewicz, Kuma, Gawron, Knysak, & Kosmider, 2013; Trehy 
et al., 2011; Vansickel & Eissenberg, 2013; Vansickel, Cobb, 
Weaver,  &  Eissenberg,  2010;  Williams,  Villarreal,  Bozhilov, 
Lin, & Talbot, 2013).

Analysis  of  global  e-cigarette  marketing  indicates  that 
the  products  are  promoted  to  circumvent  smoke-free  poli-
cies  and  to  reduce  exposure  to  secondhand  smoke  (Grana  & 
Ling, 2013). Although no sidestream vapor is generated from 
e-cigarettes between puffs, some of the vapor is exhaled by the 
user. A study by Schripp, Markewitz, Uhde, and Salthammer 
(2013)  showed  that  ultrafine  particles,  volatile  organic  com-
pounds (VOCs), and nicotine are released with exhaled vapor. 
McAuley, Hopke, Zhao, and Babaian (2012) investigated emis-
sions and indoor air concentrations of common tobacco smoke 
by-products  from  four  different  vaporized  nicotine  solutions 
and found that they emitted traces of carbonyls, polyaromatic 
hydrocarbons,  tobacco-specific  nitrosamines,  and  glycols. 
There  is  limited  evidence  whether  passive  “vaping”  exposes 
nonusers  to  nicotine.  One  study  showed  that  1-hr  exposure 
to  secondhand  cigarette  smoke  and  to  exhaled  “secondhand” 
e-cigarette vapors generated similar effects on serum cotinine 
levels (Flouris et al., 2013).

As  the  popularity  of  e-cigarettes  increases,  it  is  becoming 
important to further investigate patterns and levels of passive 
exposure to nicotine and other toxicants from e-cigarettes. The 
present study explores various factors that might contribute to 
emission of chemicals from e-cigarettes. It also aims to com-
pare the passive exposure to nicotine, particulates, carbon mon-
oxide (CO), and VOCs from electronic and tobacco cigarettes.

Materials and MethOds

Study Protocols

We  conducted  two  studies  to  assess  emissions  from  e-ciga-
rettes. The first study (Study 1) was designed to evaluate major 
factors that might affect exposure patterns. We generated vapor 
from  three  different  models  of  e-cigarettes  and  released  the 
vapor into an experimental exposure chamber. The aim of the 
second study (Study 2) was to compare emissions from e-cig-
arettes and cigarette smoke generated by experienced users of 
both products. Both studies are described in details below.

Study With Machine-Generated Vapors (Study 1)

Study  1  consisted  of  12  experiments  (Table  1;  Experiments 
1–12) conducted in an exposure chamber, each one lasting 2 hr. 
During the first hour, background levels of all analyzed mark-
ers were taken. During the second hour, vapor from e-cigarettes 
was generated using a smoking machine and released into the 
exposure chamber. We measured 1-hr average concentrations 

656

of nicotine, aerosol particles (PM2.5), CO, and selected VOCs. 
We also monitored changes in PM2.5 and CO levels over 2 hr.

Electronic Cigarettes
We studied three different models of e-cigarettes selected from 
the popular brands in Poland: (a) Colinss Age with Camel High 
atomized  cartridge  (cartomizer)  (Colins  Poland;  EC1);  (b) 
Dekang 510 Pen with SGC Regular cartridge (Ecigars Polska; 
EC2); and (c) Mild M201 Pen with Marlboro cartridge (Mild 
Poland; EC3). Although all cartridges were labeled as contain-
ing 18 mg of nicotine, our previous study showed that they dif-
fered in nicotine levels: Colinss Camel contained 11 mg, SGC 
Regular contained 18 mg, and Mild Marlboro contained 19 mg 
of the drug (Goniewicz, Kuma, et al., 2013). All products were 
purchased from online stores or shopping mall kiosks, and e-cig-
arettes batteries were charged for 24 hr before the experiments.

Exposure Chamber
A 39-m3 laboratory room (3.4 × 4.1 × 2.8 m) was equipped as 
an exposure chamber. The chamber had plain acrylic painted 
walls and tiled floor, with no windows, carpets, linings, or cur-
tains inside. It was equipped with a regulated exhaust, ventila-
tion system, and two fans for mixing the indoor air. Inside the 
chamber,  there  was  a  sampling  station  equipped  with  pumps 
and  monitors,  a  smoking  machine  for  generating  e-cigarette 
vapors (see Generation of Vapors From E-Cigarettes section), 
and  two  chairs.  The  sampling  station  was  located  1  m  from 
a smoking machine and 10 cm above the level of e-cigarettes.

The air exchange rates were determined before each experi-
ment  using  a  ventilation  marker  (methane)  released  into  the 
exposure  chamber  according  to  the  method  described  pre-
viously  (Czogala  &  Goniewicz,  2005).  The  ventilation  rate 
during  the  study  varied  from  1.37  (low)  to  12.6  (high)  air 
changes per hour (see also Supplementary Materials). Before 
each experiment, all surfaces inside the chamber were decon-
taminated  by  wiping  with  10%  aqueous  solution  of  ethanol 
and intensive ventilation. Only one person, who operated the 
smoking machine and sampling station, was allowed inside the 
exposure chamber during Study 1.

Generation of Vapors From E-Cigarettes
In  order  to  generate  vapors  from  the  e-cigarettes,  a  smoking 
machine  was  placed  in  the  exposure  chamber.  We  used  an 
automatic  single-channel  piston-operated  smoking  machine 
Palaczbot  (Technical  University  of  Lodz)  designed  to  gener-
ate vapor from e-cigarettes (Goniewicz, Knysak, et al., 2013; 
Goniewicz, Kuma, et al., 2013). In all experiments, the vapors 
from  e-cigarettes  were  generated  using  the  following  puff-
ing  conditions:  puff  volume  of  70 ml,  puff  duration  of  1.8  s, 
and intervals between puffs of 10 s. Two doses of vapor (see 
Generation of Vapors From E-Cigarettes section) were released 
into the exposure chamber with 30-min interval.

Vapors were generated from each of the three e-cigarettes 
under two variants of ventilation (intensive vs. restricted) and 
two variants of emission pattern (high vs. low) (3 brands × 2 
variants of ventilation × 2 variants of emission). Ventilation of 
the exposure chamber was controlled during each experiment 
and adjusted by operating the exhaust. During the experiments 
with intensive ventilation, exhaust from the exposure chamber 
was fully opened, while it was partly closed during the experi-
ments with restricted ventilation.

secondhand exposure to vapors from e-cigarettes

In order to modify exposure patterns, vapors from  e-ciga-
rettes  were  generated  using  7  or  15  puffs,  for  low  and  high 
exposure,  respectively.  The  rationale  for  using  two  levels  of 
exposure (low vs. high) was to examine various doses of nico-
tine  released  with  secondhand  vapor.  Although  studies  have 
shown  that  e-cigarette  vapors  contain  significant  amounts  of 
nicotine, there are some controversy as to whether this nicotine 
is effectively absorbed in the lungs (Zhang, Sumner, & Chen, 
2013). If there is little absorption, vapor exhaled by e-cigarette 
users might contain high levels of the drug. We assumed that if 
an e-cigarette user takes 15 puffs, and no nicotine is absorbed, 
then the entire amount of nicotine would be exhaled. If e-cig-
arettes effectively deliver nicotine to the bloodstream, exhaled 
vapors will contain only some of nicotine inhaled by the user. 
By  releasing  7  puffs,  we  simulated  the  scenario  in  which 
approximately half of the nicotine from 15 puffs is absorbed 
and the balance is exhaled.

Analytical Procedures
Nicotine was measured using gas chromatography with  nitrogen–
phosphorus detector following active sampling on XAD-4 sorp-
tion  tubes  (SKC  Inc.)  according  to  the  National  Institute  of 
Occupational Safety and Health reference method 2551 (National 
Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, 2003) with a detec-
tion limit of 0.22 μg/m3. Aerosol particles (PM2.5) were measured 
continuously with a SidePak AM510 Personal Aerosol Monitor. 
CO was also measured continuously with a Q-Trak Indoor Air 
Quality  8550  monitor  (both  instruments  from  TSI  Inc.).  The 
Sidepak was used with a calibration factor setting of 0.32, suit-
able for secondhand smoke (Jiang et al., 2011; Klepeis, Ott, & 
Switzer, 2007). VOCs were analyzed using gas chromatography 
with  mass  spectrometry  following  active  sampling  on Anasorb 
CSC  sorption  tubes  (SKC  Inc.)  according  to  the  Occupational 
Safety  and  Hazards  Agency  reference  method  (Occupational 
Safety  and  Hazards  Agency,  2000).  The  method  allowed  us 
to  measure  11  compounds:  benzene,  toluene,  chlorobenzene, 
ethylbenzene,  m,p-xylene,  o-xylene,  styrene,  naphthalene, 
1,2-dichlorobenzene, 1,3-dichlorobenzene, and 1,4-dichloroben-
zene. Each monitor was calibrated according to manufacturer’s 
recommendations,  and  all  analytical  procedures  were  validated 
and described in details in the Supplementary Materials.

Study With Human-Generated Vapors and Smoke 
(Study 2)

Subjects
We recruited five volunteers (all male; average age 37.6 ± 16.0; 
body mass index 23.4 ± 2.1; nicotine dependence by Fagerström 
Test for Nicotine Dependence 5.8 ± 2.9), who were dual users 
of  e-cigarettes  and  conventional  tobacco  cigarettes. The  sub-
jects  reported  using  e-cigarettes  on  average  14 ± 7  times  a 
day  for  at  least  8  months  (12.0 ± 4.2)  and  additionally  smok-
ing  on  average  11 ± 6  cigarettes  per  day  for  at  least  5  years 
(18.2 ± 14.1).  Two  subjects  reported  using  M201  pen-style 
e-cigarette (18 mg/ml; Mild brand), two others used eGo model 
(16 mg/ml; Janty brand), and one used M401 model (18 mg/ml; 
Nicore brand, Atina Poland). Three volunteers smoked L&M 
Blue Label brand of cigarettes (ISO yields/cigarette: nicotine 
0.6 mg; tar 8 mg; CO 9 mg), and two smoked Marlboro Gold 
brand (nicotine 0.5 mg; tar 7 mg; CO 7 mg). All volunteers who 
participated  in  experiments  were  not  given  any  money,  gifts, 
or other economic incentives. Study 2 protocol was reviewed 

658

and approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Medical 
University of Silesia, Poland.

Emission of E-Cigarettes Vapors and Tobacco Smoke
Study  2  comprised  five  experiments  (Table  1;  Experiments 
13–17), each lasting for 3 hr. After background measures were 
taken for 1 hr, a volunteer entered the room. Each volunteer used 
ad libitum their own e-cigarette twice for 5 min with a 30-min 
interval.  Then,  the  room  was  decontaminated  as  described 
above  and  ventilated  for  5 min.  In  the  last  hour,  each  subject 
smoked ad libitum entire tobacco cigarettes of their own brand. 
As with e-cigarettes, volunteers smoked two cigarettes lighting 
the  second  cigarette  30 min  after  the  first.  One-hour  average 
concentrations of nicotine, aerosol particles (PM2.5), CO, and 
VOCs were determined as described above (baseline, e-ciga-
rette,  and  tobacco  cigarette).  PM2.5  and  CO  levels  were  also 
monitored continuously over 3 hr of each experiment. Only two 
persons were allowed in the exposure chamber during Study 2: 
volunteer and operator of the sampling station.

Statistical Analysis

We compared average concentrations of each airborne marker 
using  a  nonparametric  Mann–Whitney  test.  For  both  studies, 
we  assessed  the  differences  between  baseline  measures  and 
each  test  condition  (e-cigarette  and  tobacco  cigarette).  For 
Study 2, we also assessed differences in average indoor con-
centrations  of  each  marker  between  electronic  and  tobacco 
cigarettes. For all tests, Statistica 10.0 software (StatSoft Inc.) 
was used. The significance level was established as p < .05.

Secondhand Exposure to Nicotine From E-Cigarettes

Study 1
Nicotine was detected in the air during all experiments where 
e-cigarette  vapor  was  generated  with  the  smoking  machine 
and released into the exposure chamber. Mean 1-hr concentra-
tion of nicotine was 2.51 ± 1.68 µg/m3 and ranged from 0.82 to 
6.23 µg/m3. Comparison of average indoor air nicotine concen-
trations in the exposure chamber from three e-cigarette brands 
are presented in Figure 1. Changes between baseline values and 
an  average  nicotine  concentration  after  emission  of  machine-
generated vapors from e-cigarettes are presented in Table 1.

Study 2
Figure  2  shows  baseline  concentrations  of  nicotine  and  1-hr 
medium concentrations after using e-cigarettes or after smok-
ing  tobacco  cigarettes  by  volunteers. The  average  concentra-
tion  of  nicotine  resulting  from  smoking  tobacco  cigarettes 
was  10  times  higher  than  from  e-cigarettes  (31.60 ± 6.91  vs. 
3.32 ± 2.49 µg/m3, respectively; p = .0081).

Secondhand Exposure to PM2.5 From E-Cigarettes

Study 1
Aerosol particles were detected in the air during all experiments 
with vapor generated with the smoking machine and released 
into  the  exposure  chamber.  Mean  concentration  of  PM2.5 
was  33.1 ± 26.9  μg/m3  and  ranged  from  6.6  to  85.0  μg/m3.

than  from  e-cigarettes  (819.3 ± 228.6  vs.  151.7 ± 86.8  μg/m3, 
respectively; p = .0081). Figure 3 shows changes in PM2.5 con-
centration in the exposure chamber during one of the experi-
ments in Study 2 (Experiment 15; see Table 1).

Study 2
Figure 2 shows baseline concentrations of PM2.5 and 1-hr mean 
concentrations after using e-cigarettes or after smoking tobacco 
cigarettes  by  volunteers.  The  mean  concentration  of  PM2.5 
resulting from smoking tobacco cigarettes was 7 times higher 

Secondhand Exposure to CO From E-Cigarette

Studies 1 and 2
There were no changes in CO concentration after using e-cig-
arettes  in  both  studies  (p  >  .05).  However  smoking  of  two 
tobacco cigarettes in Study 2 increased CO concentration in the

exposure chamber on average by 2 to 3 ppm (vol/vol) (Table 1; 
p < .05).

Secondhand Exposure to VOCs From E-Cigarettes

Study 1
During  the  study  with  machine-generated  e-cigarette  vapor, 
only  toluene  was  detected  in  the  exposure  chamber.  No  sta-
tistical difference was found between average toluene concen-
tration  after  release  of  e-cigarette  vapor  and  baseline  values 
(6.63 ± 0.21 vs. 4.15 ± 2.69 µg/m3, respectively; p = .1582).

Study 2
As  with  Study  1,  toluene  was  the  only VOC  detected  in  the 
exposure  chamber,  and  the  use  of  e-cigarette  did  not  change 
the  concentration  of  toluene  (3.79 ± 2.16  vs.  4.09 ± 2.12  µg/
m3, respectively; p = .8513). Smoking two tobacco cigarettes 
increased the concentration of four compounds: toluene, eth-
ylbenzene,  m,p-xylene,  and  o-xylene  (p  <  .05).  For  toluene, 
the  average  concentration  after  smoking  tobacco  cigarettes 
was 3.5-fold higher than after using e-cigarettes (14.75 ± 6.02 
vs. 4.15 ± 2.69 µg/m3, respectively; p < .05). The average con-
centrations  of  ethylbenzene,  m,p-xylene,  and  o-xylene  after 
smoking tobacco cigarettes were  1.17 ± 1.44, 1.94 ± 1.14, and 
0.48 ± 0.95 µg/m3, respectively; p < .05).

disCussiOn

Principal Findings

The key finding of this study is that e-cigarettes emit significant 
amounts of nicotine but do not emit significant amounts of CO 
and VOCs. We also found that the level of secondhand expo-
sure  to  nicotine  depends  on  the  e-cigarette  brand.  However, 
the emissions of nicotine from e-cigarettes were significantly 
lower than those of tobacco cigarettes.

Strengths and Limitations of the Study

To  our  knowledge,  this  is  one  of  the  first  studies  to  measure 
the concentrations of nicotine, PM2.5, CO, and VOCs emitted 

by e-cigarettes and to compare the emissions of electronic and 
conventional tobacco cigarettes in a conventionally ventilated, 
full-sized  room.  By  comparing  e-cigarette  vapors  generated 
with  a  smoking  machine  to  those  generated  by  experienced 
e-cigarette users in a controlled setting allowed us to control 
for potential factors that may affect exposure patterns.

Results  from  experiments  with  human  subjects  who  used 
both electronic and tobacco cigarettes allowed us to compare 
the emissions and the potential exposures by the two products. 
One of the most important aspects of our study is that the e-cig-
arette vapors and tobacco smoke were generated by long-term 
dual users of the products, and we did not modified the way 
volunteers were typically using the products.

Our  findings  are  supported  by  results  from  study  by 
McAuley et al. (2012) who examined the chemical composi-
tion of freshly generated vapor collected in a small emission 
chamber  and  found  that  the  total  air  emission  concentrations 
for many pollutants from e-cigarettes were very low. Our study 
examined the potential effect of various e-cigarette brands on 
patterns  of  exposure,  whereas  McAuley  et  al.  (2012)  studied 
vapors generated from the same model of e-cigarette with vary-
ing  nicotine  solutions  and  found  that  the  chemical  composi-
tion of the vapors from different solutions differed in levels of 
nicotine and other chemicals. Our study showed that the level 
of exposure also differs between e-cigarette brands. These find-
ings are also consisted with our previously reported data show-
ing high variability in composition of freshly generated vapors 
among  the  products  (Goniewicz,  Kuma,  et  al.,  2013).  These 
findings should be taken into careful consideration when expo-
sure to e-cigarette vapors is considered.

The  study  has  several  limitations. An  important  limitation 
of our study is that we measured a limited number of chemi-
cals  that  might  be  contained  within  e-cigarette  vapors.  We 
reported  previously  that  e-cigarette  vapors  contain  significant 
levels  of  carbonyls,  including  toxic  and  carcinogenic  formal-
dehyde,  acetaldehyde,  and  acrolein  (Goniewicz,  Knysak,  
et al., 2013). These compounds were not measured in this study. 
Studies by Schripp, Markewitz, Uhde, and Salthammer (2013) 
and McAuley et al. (2012) found that there is a risk of exposure 
to carbonyls from e-cigarettes, although the levels of the com-
pounds were lower than those in SHS. We did not investigate 

660

other  significant  factors  affecting  exposure  to  e-cigarette 
vapors, for example, room volume and number of e-cigarettes 
used  simultaneously  in  a  single  room. The  exposure  chamber 
input air was not filtered during the experiments, and ventila-
tion air exchange rates of exposure chamber were higher than 
residential rates (Yamamoto, Shendell, Winer, & Zhang, 2010). 
Finally, the study assessed concentrations of several markers in 
the air but not serum concentrations in people exposed to sec-
ondhand vapors. These airborne concentrations do not necessar-
ily reflect the serum concentration and the impact on health of 
people exposed to these vapors.

Unanswered Questions and Future Research

This  study  did  not  test  potential  health  effects  associated 
with  secondhand  exposure  to  vapors  from  e-cigarettes.  To 
date,  there  are  few  studies  that  have  tested  the  acute  effects 
of brief exposure to secondhand e-cigarette vapors. One study 
by  Flouris  et  al.  (2012)  found  that  acute  passive  “vaping”  of 
e-cigarettes did not influence complete blood count in human 
subjects. Another  study  by  the  same  authors  found  that  con-
trolled 1-hr exposure to e-cigarette vapors did not significantly 
affect  lung  function  in  human  subjects  (Flouris  et  al.,  2013). 
We found no publications on the cardiovascular effects of pas-
sive exposure to e-cigarette vapors or on the health effects of 
secondhand  exposure  to  e-cigarette  vapors  among  vulnerable 
population,  including  children,  pregnant  women,  and  people 
with cardiovascular conditions.

There is some discrepancy between our findings and results 
reported recently by Flouris et al. (2013) on secondhand exposure 
to nicotine. Our data suggest that secondhand exposure to nicotine 
from e-cigarettes is on average 10 times less than from tobacco 
smoke. However, Flouris et al. (2013) found that e-cigarettes and 
tobacco  cigarette  generated  similar  effects  on  serum  cotinine 
levels  after  1-hr  passive  exposure  (2.4 ± 0.9  vs.  2.6 ± 0.6 ng/ml, 
respectively; p < .001). Future research should look for correla-
tion between indoor air levels of nicotine from e-cigarettes and its 
uptake by passive smokers to explain this discrepancy.

Future  research  should  also  study  exposure  patterns  over 
extended  periods  of  time  and  the  potential  health  effects  of 
long-term  exposure  to  secondhand  e-cigarette  vapors.  Data 
are  also  needed  from  the  field  studies  conducted  in  homes 
and public places where e-cigarettes are in use. Moreover, this 
study only focused on nicotine and a limited number of chemi-
cals  released  from  e-cigarettes.  Further  research  is  needed  to 
explore emission and exposure to other toxicants and carcino-
gens  identified  in  e-cigarettes,  for  example,  carbonyl  com-
pounds (Goniewicz, Knysak, et al., 2013).

It  remains  unclear  whether  concentration  of  PM2.5  will 
be  a  suitable  and  reliable  airborne  marker  to  evaluate  emis-
sion  and  exposure  to  secondhand  vapors  from  e-cigarettes. 
Although some studies suggest that e-cigarette vapor and SHS 
have comparable aerosol particle size distribution and deposi-
tion patterns, we found that concentration of e-cigarette aero-
sol particles tends to decrease rapidly when diluted in the air. 
Figure 3 shows that there is a significant particle mass signal 
from e-cigarette vapor but that it dissipates much more rapidly 
than cigarette smoke. This may be due to the evaporation of the 
aerosol in addition to deposition on the surfaces and removal 
by  ventilation.  There  is  a  need  for  developing  an  accurate 
methodology to assess e-cigarette vapor indoor concentrations. 
Finally, the vapor from e-cigarettes might be easily deposited 

nicotine & tobacco research

on surfaces to form “thirdhand” e-cigarette vapor, and studies 
are needed to assess the deposition rate, potential formation of 
toxic derivatives, and human exposure.

Implications for Policy Makers

The  study  showed  that  e-cigarettes  might  involuntarily  expose 
nonsmokers and people who do not use e-cigarettes to nicotine. 
In the past, secondhand exposure to nicotine has been primarily 
associated with exposure to ETS. E-cigarettes have created the 
new scenario under which bystanders might be exposed to low 
levels  of  nicotine  but  not  to  the  other  toxins  found  in  tobacco 
smoke. It remains unclear whether exposure to low levels of nic-
otine indoors causes any harm to bystanders, including children, 
pregnant women, and person with cardiovascular conditions.

Besides  nicotine,  e-cigarette  vapor  contains  significant 
amounts of propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin. Although 
both compounds are considered to be safe, there is lack of data on 
health risk associated with prolonged exposure to their vapors. 
Propylene glycol has been shown to cause upper airway irrita-
tion (Vardavas et al., 2011). Some volatile carbonyl compounds 
have been also identified in the vapor of e-cigarettes (Goniewicz, 
Knysak, et al., 2013). More research is needed about the health 
risk associated with exposure to toxic constituents of the vapors. 
The physicochemical changes may also occur after vapors are 
released into ambient air. It has been shown that such changes 
increase  toxicity  of  tobacco  smoke  two-  to  four-fold  (Schick 
&  Glantz,  2006).  These  data  are  needed  to  inform  regulators 
whether e-cigarettes should be included under smoke-free poli-
cies to protect nonusers from inhaling the toxicants.

E-cigarettes are promoted to circumvent smoke-free policies 
(Grana & Ling, 2013). Exempting e-cigarettes from smoke-free 
regulations, besides creating secondhand exposure to nicotine, 
might have additional implications for public health. It remains 
unclear  whether  observation  of  smokers  using  e-cigarettes, 
especially by young people, might reverse the denormalization 
of smoking behavior as a social norm. Cigarette smokers might 
use e-cigarettes as additional sources of nicotine in places with 
smoking bans. Data are needed to determine whether dual use 
of the products (e-cigarettes in addition to tobacco cigarettes) 
results in reinforcement of nicotine addiction.
