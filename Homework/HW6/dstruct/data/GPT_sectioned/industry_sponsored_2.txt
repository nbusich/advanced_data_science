### Abstract:
Cigarette smoke is associated with severe chronic diseases. The most harmful components of cigarette smoke derive from the combustion process, which are significantly reduced in the electronic cigarette aerosol, thus providing a valid option in harm reduction strategies. To develop safer products, it is therefore necessary to screen electronic cigarette liquids (eliquids) to meet high safety standards defined by government regulations. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of metal and plasticderived contaminants in four different commercial eliquids with high concentration of nicotine and their cytotoxic effect in normal human bronchial epithelial cells by a number of in vitro assays, in comparison with the 1R6F reference cigarette, using an airliquid interface (ALI) exposure system. Moreover, we evaluated the effect of aerosol exposure on oxidative stress by measuring the production of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial potential. Our results showed no contaminants in all eliquids and a significantly reduced cytotoxic effect of eliquid aerosol compared to cigarette smoke as well as a maintained mitochondria integrity. Moreover, no production of reactive oxygen species was detected with ecigarette aerosol. In conclusion, these results support the reduced toxicity potential of ecigs compared to tobacco cigarettes in an in vitro model resembling reallife smoke exposure.



### Discussion (Key Highlights):
The tested eliquids showed a good safety profile in terms of absence of micro and nanoplastics despite the plastic packaging, highlighting a good quality of the material used and production processes, transport, and storage of the products before marketing. In addition, the liquids showed a very low concentration of trace elements, confirming their safety with respect to the contaminants of products intended for human consumption. Among the metallic elements, only aluminum (Al) and iron (Fe) showed values significantly above the LOD. Within acceptable standards, these concentrations were considered safe for human consumption.

Consistently, all tested eliquids showed an excellent safety profile and low toxicity even after vaporization with an ecig, albeit with a slightly different profile from one liquid to another. Although the PG/VG solution with nicotine produces some reactive oxygen species (ROS) during vaporization (possibly due to nicotine pyrolysis), products A–C did not produce ROS in the cellfree system, suggesting the aromatic part of the products may offset ROS production. Product D showed increased ROS production in the system compared to products A–C but still significantly lower than PG/VG with nicotine alone. Efforts to adjust the flavoring components in product D could reduce ROS production while maintaining its sensory properties.

The cytotoxic effect of the eliquids was significantly reduced compared to cigarette smoke. Using three different approaches (RTCA analysis, NRU analysis by HCS, and morphological analysis of the nuclei), eliquids exhibited excellent cell viability and adhesion/proliferation compared to the 1R6F reference cigarette. Product D even showed increased cell viability compared to the AIR control, possibly due to its flavoring components. Mitochondrial potential analysis confirmed that eliquids did not cause mitochondrial dysfunction, unlike significant disruption observed in 1R6F smoke exposure.

A potential limitation of this study is that it did not evaluate the toxicological effects of eliquids under different device settings, such as varied power and temperature, which could generate different results. Additionally, the exact chemical composition of the flavorings in the tested eliquids was not disclosed, limiting an indepth understanding of their interactions and effects.



### Conclusion:
Our results support the reduced harmful potential of ecigarettes relative to tobacco cigarettes in an in vitro model of normal human bronchial epithelial cells and support the use of electronic cigarettes as a viable strategy in harm reduction strategies for smokers.
