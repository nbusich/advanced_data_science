### Abstract  
: Electronic cigarettes (ecigarettes) are designed to generate inhalable nicotine aerosol (vapor). When an ecigarette user takes a puff, the nicotine solution is heated and the vapor is taken into the lungs. Although no sidestream vapor is generated between puffs, some of the mainstream vapor is exhaled by the ecigarette user. The aim of this study was to evaluate the secondhand exposure to nicotine and other tobaccorelated toxicants from ecigarettes.  

: We measured selected airborne markers of secondhand exposure: nicotine, aerosol particles (PM2.5), carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in an exposure chamber. We generated ecigarette vapor from 3 various brands of ecigarette using a smoking machine and controlled exposure conditions. We also compared secondhand exposure with ecigarette vapor and tobacco smoke generated by 5 dual users.  

: The study showed that ecigarettes are a source of secondhand exposure to nicotine but not to combustion toxicants. The air concentrations of nicotine emitted by various brands of ecigarettes ranged from 0.82 to 6.23 µg/m³. The average concentration of nicotine resulting from smoking tobacco cigarettes was 10 times higher than from ecigarettes (31.60 ± 6.91 vs. 3.32 ± 2.49 µg/m³, respectively; p = .0081).  

: Using an ecigarette in indoor environments may involuntarily expose nonusers to nicotine but not to toxic tobaccospecific combustion products. More research is needed to evaluate health consequences of secondhand exposure to nicotine, especially among vulnerable populations, including children, pregnant women, and people with cardiovascular conditions.  

  

### Key Defining Sentences  
1. "Ecigarettes emit significant amounts of nicotine but do not emit significant amounts of CO and VOCs."  
2. "The emissions of nicotine from ecigarettes were significantly lower than those of tobacco cigarettes."  
3. "Using an ecigarette in indoor environments may involuntarily expose nonusers to nicotine but not to toxic tobaccospecific combustion products."  
4. "It remains unclear whether exposure to low levels of nicotine indoors causes any harm to bystanders, including children, pregnant women, and persons with cardiovascular conditions."  

  

### Discussion  
The key finding of this study is that ecigarettes emit significant amounts of nicotine but do not emit significant amounts of CO and VOCs. We also found that the level of secondhand exposure to nicotine depends on the ecigarette brand. However, the emissions of nicotine from ecigarettes were significantly lower than those of tobacco cigarettes.  

This study measured the concentrations of nicotine, PM2.5, CO, and VOCs emitted by ecigarettes and compared the emissions of electronic and conventional tobacco cigarettes in a fullsized, conventionally ventilated room. Experimental conditions, including machinegenerated and humangenerated vapor, allowed for controlled evaluations. Results showed significant emissions of nicotine from ecigarettes and increased PM2.5 levels, though still much lower than those from tobacco cigarettes. The lack of increased CO or VOC emissions from ecigarettes suggests reduced toxicant profiles compared to conventional cigarettes.  

Further studies are required to investigate the potential health effects of longterm exposure to secondhand ecigarette vapors. Future research should also study exposure patterns over extended periods, concentrations of other toxicants in ecigarette vapors, and the health impacts of thirdhand exposure.  

  

### Conclusion  
The study showed that ecigarettes might involuntarily expose nonsmokers and people who do not use ecigarettes to nicotine. Ecigarettes have created a new scenario under which bystanders might be exposed to low levels of nicotine but not to the other toxins found in tobacco smoke. It remains unclear whether exposure to low levels of nicotine indoors causes any harm to bystanders, including children, pregnant women, and those with cardiovascular conditions.  

Data are needed to inform regulators whether ecigarettes should be included under smokefree policies to protect nonusers from inhaling the toxicants. Exempting ecigarettes from smokefree regulations might have additional implications for public health, including potential normalization of smoking behavior and reinforcement of nicotine addiction by dual users.
