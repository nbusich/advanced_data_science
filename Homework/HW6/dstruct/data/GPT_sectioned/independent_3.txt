  
Cigarette smoking is the most important cause of premature death, and it is currently listed as a major independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Because of restrictive measures and widespread control policies, tobacco companies are now using aggressive marketing strategies in favor of smokeless tobacco, including electronic nicotine delivery systems, which are also known as electronic cigarettes or ecigarettes. Although the regular use of these devices appears less hazardous than traditional cigarettes or other forms of smokeless tobacco, recent studies have shown that various potentially harmful substances, especially nicotine, ultraparticles, and volatile organic compounds, may be effectively inhaled or liberated in exhaled air during repeated ecigarette puffing. This would enhance the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension, which may predispose some users to increased risk of cardiovascular events, which may be further magnified by other potential adverse effects such as arrhythmias, increased respiratory, and flow respiratory resistance. Some cases of intoxication have also been described, wherein large amounts of nicotine and other harmful compounds may be effectively absorbed. As the use of ecigarettes is continuously rising, and it is also considered a potentially effective method for smoking cessation, more focused research is urgently needed to definitely establish the cardiovascular safeness of these devices.

  
Strongly propelled by easy availability through the Web, the worldwide market of ecigarettes continues to grow, despite limited information on their safety, adverse effects, and even efficacy for smoking cessation. Although ecigarettes are expected to generate and/or release fewer dangerous substances than conventional tobacco cigarettes, and current evidence provides limited support for a comparative lessened increased cardiovascular risk in current users, there are some important issues that should be emphasized about the currently claimed safety of these devices.

Thus, although the use of ecigarette appears more favorable than traditional cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products, recent data conversely attests that the more typical patterns of use may be associated with significant release of nicotine, thus producing a plasma nicotine concentration which may ultimately approximate that of traditional cigarette smoking, because the minute nicotine particles contained in the vapor allow fast and effective delivery into the bloodstream. This would explain the enhanced risk of cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension, which may predispose some users—especially those with coronary atherosclerosis or other known cardiovascular risk factors—to a substantial risk of acute coronary syndrome, which may be further magnified by other potential adverse effects (i.e., arrhythmias, increased respiratory, and flow respiratory resistance). Some cases of intoxication, wherein an amount of nicotine and other harmful compounds may be absorbed at a much larger extent than with traditional cigarettes, have also been reported. According to this data, ecigarettes have been classified as “drug delivery devices” in several countries, and their marketing has been temporarily limited or even suspended until safety profile and efficacy will be finally established in clinical trials. The US Food and Drug Administration has also publicly discouraged the use of these devices in July 2009, raising serious concerns that ecigarettes may be marketed to young people and lack appropriate health warnings.

Basically, their large and easy availability on the Web, a phenomenon that has several points in common with the “black market” of doping substances, combined with the existence of a clear dose–response relationship effect on cardiovascular risk suggests that major caution regarding the use of these devices should be used, especially in persons at increased risk of developing cardiovascular events. The effects on blood pressure and heart rate are particularly concerning, as hypertension is a wellestablished cardiovascular risk factor, whereas heart rate is a significant predictor of mortality in patients with known cardiovascular disease. It is also noteworthy that ecigarettes require stronger vacuums (suction) than conventional tobacco cigarette, and this effect remains unclear on enhanced absorption of dangerous substances and human health. As the use of ecigarettes is continuously rising, and it may be a potentially effective approach for smoking cessation, more focused research is urgently needed to definitely establish the cardiovascular safety of these devices. Should ecigarettes be less harmful than traditional tobacco smoking or smokeless tobacco, then this would represent a favorable alternative for tobacco addictions, but may conversely pose serious threat on more fragile members of the society such as children and teens, who may be persuaded to start using electronic cigarette with unproven assumption of safety, become addicted to nicotine and eventually begin to smoke tobacco cigarettes, or worse abuse the level of active compounds in refill bottles with potential catastrophic outcome.
