Here are key sections of the text that contribute significantly to its meaning:

### Abstract (Introduction of Research Paper):
> Electronic cigarettes (ecigarettes) are products that deliver  
a nicotinecontaining aerosol (commonly called vapor) to  
users by heating a solution typically made up of propylene  
glycol or glycerol (glycerin), nicotine, and flavoring agents  
(Figure 1), invented in their current form by Chinese pharmacist Hon Lik in the early 2000s.1 The US patent application  
describes the ecigarette device as “an electronic atomization  
cigarette that functions as substitutes [sic] for quitting smoking and cigarette substitutes” (patent No. 8,490,628 B2). By  
2013, the major multinational tobacco companies had entered  
the ecigarette market...  
...Despite many unanswered questions about their safety, efficacy for harm reduction and cessation, and total impact on  
public health.



### Key Defining Sentences:
1. *"Health claims and claims of efficacy for quitting smoking are unsupported by the scientific evidence to date."*
2. *"Ecigarettes deliver lower levels of some of the toxins found in cigarette smoke but still expose primary users and bystanders to harmful chemicals."*
3. *"Dual use of ecigarettes and conventional cigarettes is the predominant pattern among users, particularly youth."*
4. *"Although data are limited, it is clear that ecigarette emissions are not merely 'harmless water vapor' as is frequently claimed."*



### Methods:
> Initial searches conducted via PubMed using the keywords electronic cigarette, ecigarette, and electronic nicotine delivery systems yielded 151 studies (Figure 2). Seventyone articles presented original data and were included... Working with the World Health Organization, we also contacted investigators to locate other studies, some of which had not yet been published... The results of these searches were used to prepare a report commissioned by the World Health Organization Tobacco Free Initiative, which provides details of individual studies, including some studies that are not discussed in this article because of length constraints.



### Discussion:
1. *"The individual risks and benefits and the total impact of these products occur in the context of the widespread and continuing availability of conventional cigarettes and other tobacco products, with high levels of dual use of ecigarettes and conventional cigarettes at the same time."*
2. *"Nicotine is a highly addictive substance with negative effects on animal and human brain development, which is still ongoing in adolescence."*
3. *"Ecigarette use is not associated with successful quitting; all four longitudinal studies and clinical trials reviewed had a point estimate of the odds of quitting of less than 1.0."*
4. *"Ecigarette marketing has used strategies like celebrity endorsements, social media promotions, and misleading claims about health to target youth and circumvent tobacco control efforts."*



### Conclusion:
> Although most of the discussion of ecigarettes among health authorities has concentrated on the product itself, its potential toxicity, and use of ecigarettes to help people quit smoking, the ecigarette companies have been rapidly expanding using aggressive marketing messages similar to those used to promote cigarettes in the 1950s and 1960s...  
> *"...Ecigarettes are not associated with greater success in smoking cessation at a population level compared with pharmaceutical nicotine replacement therapy or quitting unassisted."*  
  
> *"Ecigarette use may result in health risks for both primary users and bystanders, reinforcing norms that undermine existing smokefree laws."*
