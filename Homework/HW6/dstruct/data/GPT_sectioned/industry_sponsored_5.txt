The paper investigates how misclassification of smoking habits influences research on environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and lung cancer, particularly among lifelong nonsmokers. The common metric for ETS exposure in such studies is being married to a smoker. Misclassification occurs when some current or former smokers claim to be lifelong nonsmokers, skewing relative risk (RR) estimates. The study explores the impact of various factors influencing this bias and proposes methods to adjust RR estimates for misclassification. The findings, based on U.S. and Asian data, suggest that misclassification substantially affects the observed risks. Differences with other studies and challenges in interpreting the ETSlung cancer association are also examined.




1. "This paper shows how various factors affect the magnitude of the bias and describes a method for obtaining misclassificationadjusted relative risk estimates."
2. "Application of the method to U.S. and Asian data for women suggests misclassification is an important determinant of the slight excess risk observed in nonsmokers married to smokers."
3. "The results above show that misclassification of a subject’s smoking habits leads to underestimation of the strength of the active smoking/lung cancer relationship and of the concordance between husbands’ and wives’ smoking habits."
4. "By contrast, providing there is positive concordance between spouses’ smoking habits, random misclassification of some subjects who smoke as nonsmokers leads to an apparent relationship of spousal smoking to risk in nonsmokers when no true relationship exists."
5. "Our paper emphasizes the difficulties of interpreting weak associations in epidemiology, and the need to quantify the various sources of bias before coming to a firm conclusion."




The paper discusses methodological improvements over past approaches and emphasizes the significance of misclassification bias in skewing the results of ETSlung cancer studies. The authors critique other studies that underestimate bias or draw conclusions from incomplete adjustments. They highlight factors like the concordance rate of smoking between spouses and the rate of misclassification (e.g., smokers incorrectly identifying as nonsmokers) as key drivers of statistical errors in estimating ETSrelated lung cancer risk. They simplify the methodology for bias estimation, comparing it to earlier complex models, and apply it to data sets from the U.S. and Asia.

Other discussions include:
1. Misclassification's smaller effect in populations with fewer smokers, such as Asian women.
2. The interplay of recall, confounding, and publication biases in ETS studies.
3. Inconsistencies in the histological evidence that would support causation for ETS exposure over biologically plausible doseresponses.

The authors also raise doubt about the biological plausibility of ETS causing lung cancer given the comparative levels of exposure to mainstream versus secondhand smoke. They assert that misclassification alone could explain much of the observed risk.




"Though there are difficulties in quantifying the exact effects of smoking habit misclassification, our analyses show its likely importance and cast doubt on simple interpretation of the association between lung cancer and spousal smoking as indicative of a cause and effect relationship." The paper concludes that while the observed association between ETS and lung cancer might point to exposure effects, misclassification introduces enough error to question causality. The authors suggest focusing on improving exposure metrics and addressing biases in future epidemiological research.
