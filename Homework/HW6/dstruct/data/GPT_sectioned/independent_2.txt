### Abstract
Electronic cigarettes (ecigarettes, ecigs, or electronic nicotine delivery systems) are batteryoperated devices typically containing glycerol and/or propylene glycolbased solutions with varying nicotine content, known as eliquids. Although ecigarettes were originally developed as a potentially less harmful alternative to traditional combustible tobacco cigarette smokers, several factors have driven their popularity among smokers and nonsmokers alike, including their sleek product designs, innumerable appealing flavors, lack of combustible smoke and odor, and high potential nicotine concentrations. Furthermore, many advocates have promoted the idea that ecigarettes are safe to use, or at least safer than conventional tobacco, despite limited longitudinal data to support these claims. Here, we examine what is known about the impacts of ecigarette use on traditional cigarette smoking cessation, lung health, and youth and young adult tobacco product exposure. Upon review of the currently available literature, the negative effects of ecigarette use seem to outweigh any potential benefit, because the available evidence does not confirm the use of ecigarettes as an effective strategy for supporting traditional combustible tobacco cigarette smoking cessation, particularly given the emerging adverse effects on lung health and the potential future public health effects of ecigarette adoption among a burgeoning new generation of tobacco product users.



### Key Defining Sentences
1. "Although ecigarettes were historically developed to supplant traditional combustible tobacco use with a less harmful alternative, several factors have driven ecigarette popularity, including their many appealing flavors, the lack of combustible smoke and odor, sleek profiles, and high potential nicotine concentrations."
2. "However, limited longitudinal data exist to support those suppositions, given the relatively recent emergence of ecigarettes as a prominent tobacco product."
3. "No clear consensus has emerged regarding the utility of ecigarettes for smoking cessation, and ecigarettes have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research for this purpose."
4. "Taken together, although some studies have shown that ecigarette use may lead to shortterm smoking cessation, they represent an inferior treatment approach relative to wellproven smoking cessation strategies, and their addictive potential combined with the lack of proven harm reduction supports caution against their use for smoking cessation."
5. "The addictive potential of ecigarettes has been shown to be comparable to or greater than that of traditional combustible cigarettes."
6. "Although ecigarettes are a relatively new addition to the tobacco product market, their recent uptake among consumers, particularly among youths and young adults, warrants significant attention given the potential implications for both individuallevel and populationbased health outcomes."



### Discussion
"Whereas we have had over 140 years to witness lung diseases caused by conventional tobacco, we have had less than 20 years to identify and classify lung diseases associated with ecigarette use. In addition, we have only recently begun regularly asking patients about and documenting ecigarette use in medical records. As such, data are limited and often rely on animal studies, case reports, series, and cohorts describing associated lung effects and symptomatology. One of the most concerning findings is a consistent demonstration of direct cytotoxic, DNAdamaging, and immunesuppressing effects associated with ecigarette aerosols, independent of nicotine content. Furthermore, emerging literature has linked ecigarettes with the development of acute and chronic lung conditions as well as systemic inflammatory responses beyond the pulmonary system."



### Conclusion
"Although ecigarettes are a relatively new addition to the tobacco product market, their recent uptake among consumers, particularly among youths and young adults, warrants significant attention given the potential implications for both individuallevel and populationbased health outcomes. Currently, the negative effects of ecigarette use seem to outweigh any potential benefit, because the available evidence does not confirm the use of ecigarettes as an effective strategy for supporting traditional combustible tobacco cigarette smoking cessation, particularly owing to the emerging adverse effects on lung health and potential future public health effects of ecigarette adoption among a burgeoning new generation of tobacco product users."
